326," It's wild, but I'm",1537.9,1539.9,9,Mike_Tyson
327, I believe is um is rightfully so to be that way and I just know how to,1539.9,1544.8200000000002,20,Mike_Tyson
328, I don't think I'm massive. I just know how to deal with it. I don't let it overwhelm me,1545.5400000000002,1550.3400000000001,27,Mike_Tyson

333," Know you're being serious, but I mean no one will understand that other than you",1566.9,1570.98,19,Mike_Tyson
334, Like that's your your mindset like no one wanted,1571.6200000000001,1574.98,12,Mike_Tyson
335, But I think that like all the things we were talking about before the way you drive yourself the way you push yourself,1574.98,1579.38,25,Mike_Tyson
336, The way you put yourself into that frame of mind. No one's gonna understand that other than you,1579.5400000000002,1583.46,22,Mike_Tyson
337, So no one's gonna understand you get an erection from thinking about hurting someone,1583.7,1587.8600000000001,18,Mike_Tyson
338, More than you will you don't have to be fear based in somewhere,1588.74,1592.5,16,Mike_Tyson
339, fear based,1593.14,1594.9,4,Mike_Tyson
340, Maybe or um maybe just,1594.98,1597.22,7,Mike_Tyson
341," Maybe not fear based, but maybe embracing the fact that you're gonna go into this with everything that you have the chaos of it all and",1599.3000000000002,1607.46,30,Mike_Tyson
342, The ultimate goal is to hurt somebody the ultimate goal is to be extremely successful the way you can be extremely successful,1608.42,1614.9,24,Mike_Tyson
343, The thing you do great is to crush people,1614.9,1617.0600000000002,11,Mike_Tyson
344, So to him they have that encompass everything this fighting is the only thing I don't ask our law for um,1617.7,1623.8600000000001,24,Mike_Tyson
345," I just thought I asked him for help for that you don't ask him for help for fight. Yeah, because you think you got it",1624.82,1629.78,30,Mike_Tyson

350, That you didn't want to reignite your ego,1653.7,1655.7,12,Mike_Tyson
351, Clearly your ego's blazing right now. I mean you're ready to go well maybe because I um,1656.1000000000001,1661.7,23,Mike_Tyson
352," I'm an addict of form of addict and I'm gonna knock out a green the cameras on me. Yeah, I'm a big knock out",1663.14,1669.14,31,Mike_Tyson
353," It can maybe right that has nothing to do it as well, but I like to think it's under control until the night of the event",1669.14,1675.14,30,Mike_Tyson
354, That yeah the night of the event so it's the the addiction will get purged with the with the performance,1675.94,1682.98,24,Mike_Tyson

357," The jean key okay, there's book in the book was explaining about why that we are",1695.8600000000001,1701.3,21,Mike_Tyson
358, Who we are in that perspective that most of the people like you and myself and people people yes in general,1701.8600000000001,1707.38,23,Mike_Tyson

380, And it's it's it's got to be so hard for a world championship fighter of your caliber to exist with like regular,1817.54,1825.7,27,Mike_Tyson
381," Normal boring life, you know when you're training and you you're ramping yourself up for a big fight",1826.1000000000001,1831.8600000000001,24,Mike_Tyson
382, And then you have that big fight and you you know,1832.18,1834.3400000000001,13,Mike_Tyson
383, You knock out spinks in front of the whole world and you're walking around the ring and you're on the cover of every magazine,1834.98,1841.06,29,Mike_Tyson
384, That the highs of that the accomplishment the training and then the competing itself is the the experience is so,1841.38,1847.38,22,Mike_Tyson
385, Alien to most people that when you walk around with regular folks in regular life,1847.6200000000001,1852.42,17,Mike_Tyson
386," It's got to it's got to be hard to exist. No, it's not it's just that um",1852.82,1856.9,25,Mike_Tyson
387, You have to know who you can be at certain times in your life. No one knows who they are because if you know who you were right now,1858.1000000000001,1865.78,32,Mike_Tyson
388," You'd be really limited, you know because life is about change you'll be told then five years from now",1865.78,1870.42,24,Mike_Tyson
389, You'd be a different person won't be this person,1870.42,1872.42,13,Mike_Tyson
390, so we're gonna have to have,1872.58,1874.58,9,Mike_Tyson
391, Develop some kind of emotional intelligence and just learn the great as time goes on,1874.98,1880.02,17,Mike_Tyson
392, Graph,1880.58,1881.62,3,Mike_Tyson
393, What's ever going on and just form with it as it changed you changed with it because it's very difficult,1881.62,1886.82,24,Mike_Tyson
394, When times change to change with the times right and you have to be conscious of that and the times is not,1887.3799999999999,1893.62,24,Mike_Tyson
395, The people around you the time is the development and time you have left in this planet that you have to develop,1894.1,1900.1799999999998,24,Mike_Tyson
396, Who you are?,1900.5,1901.46,6,Mike_Tyson
397, How difficult is it to make that change though to become a different person other than a world championship fighter,1901.6200000000001,1906.9,22,Mike_Tyson
398, Like when you decided to stop was it difficult what time will make you that person time will,1906.98,1911.8600000000001,20,Mike_Tyson
399, At time will make you that person. What is time? I don't know right,1912.1000000000001,1915.6200000000001,19,Mike_Tyson
400, But time has also made you that person again now though now now it's reignited,1916.3400000000001,1921.06,19,Mike_Tyson
401, Now new time has come and now you're training again,1921.6200000000001,1924.82,13,Mike_Tyson

530, Once you saw you then he changed his mind. Yeah,2521.0600000000004,2523.94,13,Mike_Tyson
531, Once I think when someone sees the dedication that you have that you're actually fit and you're actually moving fast,2524.82,2529.7000000000003,24,Mike_Tyson
532, And you actually can compete at a very high level. I used to have to realize that um,2530.1800000000003,2533.86,21,Mike_Tyson
533, I'm gonna go to Russian. I like that no more. I got to move around. I got to do it in a different way,2534.82,2538.26,30,Mike_Tyson

552, Nice how long did it take before you start feeling comfortable sparring the next time I spard again really yeah,2618.74,2625.2999999999997,24,Mike_Tyson
553, So the next time you spard again,2626.74,2628.74,10,Mike_Tyson
554, You just could get back into the mindset of what it's like to be competing and moving with another person,2628.74,2634.02,23,Mike_Tyson
555," Yeah, and you can't go for the kill because you know not your body's not moving for the kill now",2634.02,2638.82,25,Mike_Tyson
556," You gotta have you have to develop the relation. Oh, this is gonna be interesting when you hear this",2638.9,2643.2200000000003,23,Mike_Tyson
557, And if I'd probably just understand that more as he gets older you have to develop,2644.26,2647.78,19,Mike_Tyson
558, We're queen a relationship with your mind in your body. Mm-hmm. Your legs go here before your body's ready to go with it,2648.26,2654.82,31,Mike_Tyson
559," Right, they have to um they have to sync up. Yeah, that's a sync up now. You have to talk to hey before we're like",2655.54,2660.9,33,Mike_Tyson
560, We mean we mean before they go to it being being being now. Hey man. Let's move here. Let's move here,2660.9,2664.9,28,Mike_Tyson
561, Right to talk you lose that tenth of a second. Mm-hmm. You talk to yourself. Right. You're doing instantly,2665.14,2670.42,28,Mike_Tyson
562, So do you think eventually you'll get back to automatic,2670.9,2673.7000000000003,13,Mike_Tyson
563," Well, we're gonna see yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that too",2674.82,2678.9,23,Mike_Tyson
564," It's exciting though, man. It's very exciting to see you sparring again to see all that",2681.06,2685.06,23,Mike_Tyson
565," Um, when I when you sparring are you uh sparring technically or you sparring hard like how it's fun um",2685.78,2692.26,27,Mike_Tyson
566, Um,2692.42,2693.6200000000003,3,Mike_Tyson
567, The first time I went back to fire I tried to go all out and that was just after us,2694.42,2697.6200000000003,22,Mike_Tyson
568, I'm a body with it wasn't listening,2698.26,2700.9,11,Mike_Tyson
569," Right, right, and so I had like you said I had to develop that relationship",2700.9,2704.6600000000003,19,Mike_Tyson
570, And the second time I spored that was but that was so much better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't rushing and try to hurt nobody,2705.78,2712.1000000000004,33,Mike_Tyson
571, Kill nobody. We just trying to get work,2712.1800000000003,2714.26,11,Mike_Tyson
572," Yeah, just get working. Yeah, and how often each part of week um when we go back to spawn like spawn every day",2715.3,2721.38,28,Mike_Tyson
573," Really everything yeah, the more you do it the better it is right the more your timing is",2722.1,2726.82,21,Mike_Tyson
574, But you feel what do you thoughts on like some people think that you could spark too much and you leave too much in the gym,2726.9,2731.86,28,Mike_Tyson
575, Because you get hit too much in camp,2731.86,2733.86,10,Mike_Tyson
576," Well, that's the whole thing you learn in camp not to get hit. Mm-hmm",2734.34,2737.38,21,Mike_Tyson
577, That's the art of boxing learning not to get hit in the fight and you have to do that by trying to get in the gym,2737.38,2742.98,29,Mike_Tyson
578," Yeah, most seriously and avoiding that and then in terms of the fight",2743.2200000000003,2747.38,16,Mike_Tyson
579, So you shouldn't be in the gym saying I've been hit too much because you shouldn't get hit because that should be the objective of,2747.62,2753.38,30,Mike_Tyson
580, Fighting not to get hit as much as you believe you are,2753.94,2757.06,14,Mike_Tyson
581, What do you say to a fighter that sees themselves getting hit too much though in sparring?,2757.62,2761.54,21,Mike_Tyson
582, Do you tell them to take some time off or do you say you know know what I say?,2761.78,2765.46,22,Mike_Tyson
583, I try to teach him how not to avoid those punches and,2765.54,2768.7400000000002,14,Mike_Tyson
584, If he doesn't I don't really want to have much to do with somebody that I don't want to be involved with somebody getting hit and they get hurt and,2769.78,2776.58,35,Mike_Tyson
585," Right like that. Well, I know you were doing a lot of",2776.66,2779.46,16,Mike_Tyson
586," coaching of just even little small sessions with different fighters and yeah, there's a bunch of stuff on the internet",2780.2599999999998,2786.02,24,Mike_Tyson
587," If you have if did you think about doing that like in the future like no, no, not at this moment",2786.2599999999998,2790.5,25,Mike_Tyson
588, It just takes a really special position. They take the special person to do that,2790.5,2794.02,18,Mike_Tyson
589, You gotta be a mother father like kite dress a dietitian. It's just so many hats,2794.02,2799.7,22,Mike_Tyson
590, You have to wear and be in a trainer a good trainer true trainer to yourself in your fight,2799.7,2804.8199999999997,21,Mike_Tyson
591, This is just a lot of hats that's really overwhelming for me and my personality,2804.82,2808.98,18,Mike_Tyson
592, I totally can understand that but I would also imagine that in your mind,2809.54,2813.1400000000003,16,Mike_Tyson
593, There's some knowledge that I would love to see passed on to other fighters in a way like a trainer only a trainer can do,2813.46,2819.94,28,Mike_Tyson
594," Yeah, I'm the kind of guy you want to know from me? You gotta learn from me",2820.02,2822.6600000000003,22,Mike_Tyson

599, The perception that he knew everything you should listen to him and take his advice because he knew everything,2840.42,2845.86,21,Mike_Tyson
600," Yeah, you know, that's what it's like if you was his friend you always came to him for advice",2846.58,2850.5,25,Mike_Tyson
601, He always wanted to fight wanted to give his advice and let you know that he was a superior thinker and that you should come to him and,2850.58,2856.58,31,Mike_Tyson
602, His family a problem. That's just what he was,2856.82,2858.9,13,Mike_Tyson
603," You know, do you think everything back on your life like your life with cuss and this the story the origin story is almost like a movie",2859.62,2868.5,31,Mike_Tyson

763, You ever use an iron neck? Do you know what that's no? It's a halo. I'll give you one. I have one in the back,3630.2599999999998,3635.2999999999997,34,Mike_Tyson
764, It's a halo you put it on you pump it up it fits around your head and then it's got a bungee cord on it,3635.78,3640.6600000000003,30,Mike_Tyson
765, So you back up like this the bungee cord's 50 pounds and then you do these,3640.6600000000003,3644.34,20,Mike_Tyson
766, And because it doesn't do this with your neck it doesn't put pressure on the discs,3646.6600000000003,3650.82,20,Mike_Tyson
767, So it doesn't move the discs in an unnatural way with weight,3651.1400000000003,3653.86,15,Mike_Tyson
768," Yeah, because you can do all these different exercises on it",3654.6600000000003,3657.54,14,Mike_Tyson
769, But it doesn't ever bend your disc so it strengthens the neck without doing damage to your discs,3657.78,3664.42,22,Mike_Tyson
770," It's something just yeah, I would love that yeah, thank you. I really appreciate. I have um",3664.7400000000002,3670.26,24,Mike_Tyson

774, You can't even feel anything,3689.7400000000002,3691.7400000000002,8,Mike_Tyson
775," Is it but it's not water inside of it? Oh, it's running the treadmill. It's under plastic",3692.14,3697.02,25,Mike_Tyson

777, How's that working?,3703.18,3705.18,7,Mike_Tyson
778, You don't feel anything then you take the pants off you feel the effects the pull you might fall through the floor really yeah,3705.58,3710.9399999999996,27,Mike_Tyson
779," Really cool. So this way it doesn't fit your joints. Yeah, but listen",3711.18,3715.3399999999997,19,Mike_Tyson

781, The high running outside is almost worth messing your joints up really,3720.14,3724.7,14,Mike_Tyson
782," Yeah, but what the how you get from running outside? What's the difference? You never",3725.5,3729.66,21,Mike_Tyson

786, So like then that house on the treadmill and being outside running is like night and day you can't even compare the two,3746.94,3752.38,26,Mike_Tyson
787, Is it because you're you're moving your traveling distance? Is it because you're breathing in the fresh air like the spirit you're different?,3752.62,3759.5,31,Mike_Tyson
788, It's just a spirit you're just running here in the birds here in the,3761.02,3763.98,18,Mike_Tyson

817, I'm gonna tell you some really interesting stuff,3896.7799999999997,3898.7799999999997,11,Mike_Tyson
818, So you're saying that the running outside it's worth it just for the spiritual difference,3900.14,3905.1,19,Mike_Tyson
819, It's worth the beating up on the joints. Does it does it fuck with your joints? You have like knee problems or ankle problems these days,3905.1,3911.58,31,Mike_Tyson
820," I had to but um, but the guys I work with they take care of that right away, you know, it's almost like",3912.46,3919.74,29,Mike_Tyson

824," You know, now that time you put it in the stuff",3936.86,3938.86,14,Mike_Tyson
825, You can't get it off. It likes super glue. It is interesting what they can do today,3939.34,3943.98,22,Mike_Tyson
826, Like you could heal and recover way better than you ever could before,3944.3,3947.7400000000002,15,Mike_Tyson
827, There was no 54-year-old man that looked like you when we were kids,3947.9,3951.02,19,Mike_Tyson
828," No, no",3951.58,3952.54,5,Mike_Tyson

830," Yeah, and even Jack Elaine, I mean he was kind of fit",3954.3,3956.78,16,Mike_Tyson
831, But he was just fit because he was disciplined because he continued to exercise,3956.78,3960.38,16,Mike_Tyson
832," But this is all about yeah, okay, how good you are and anything you don't have discipline you ain't nobody right",3960.38,3965.9,27,Mike_Tyson
833, Nothing,3966.38,3968.38,3,Mike_Tyson
834, Because you give up on the slightest struggle without discipline 100% and,3968.38,3972.7000000000003,15,Mike_Tyson
835, That has to be something that you also learn from constantly. I know,3973.6600000000003,3977.1800000000003,16,Mike_Tyson
836," Discipline I don't know a discipline. He taught me discipline and do what you hate to do, but do it like you love it",3977.1800000000003,3982.2200000000003,31,Mike_Tyson

838," And if you can do that you could be successful in anything. You know, you normally are",3990.62,3994.06,21,Mike_Tyson
839, You need a best janitor in the history of janitors,3995.02,3997.42,14,Mike_Tyson
840," Yeah, and I use you that for a perspective now to put in those janitors down. Yeah, you know the best of it",3998.22,4004.38,29,Mike_Tyson

843, taught you,4015.02,4017.02,4,Mike_Tyson
844," Now I don't know all those things that cost to me will and nowadays would not be cool, you know",4017.66,4022.62,24,Mike_Tyson

847, People having opinions like women and stuff like that and because,4029.58,4033.98,13,Mike_Tyson
848, Cuss believing that he cared for the downtrodden people and this and that for the blacks and Latinos and Irish people who are being,4036.38,4045.98,29,Mike_Tyson
849," Abused by the Irish people of that time which is crazy. Um, he really um",4046.46,4052.86,20,Mike_Tyson
850, He really was that guy he was the guy to foot foot of people that,4054.7,4058.22,17,Mike_Tyson
851, That didn't have um,4058.94,4061.18,7,Mike_Tyson
852, Anyone to fight for them,4061.18,4063.18,7,Mike_Tyson
853, He was just like I he wanted to be that person,4063.18,4065.42,13,Mike_Tyson
854, He wanted to be a person that people looked up to and he was a boss and stuff,4065.5,4069.5,20,Mike_Tyson
855," He was yes, wanted to be a person and my red is book and I ran found at the bottom. He was successful his whole life",4069.5,4075.34,30,Mike_Tyson
856, He was always the guy that enabled that people came through the subtle beef and talk things over with and loan people stuff and help people out,4075.9,4083.02,29,Mike_Tyson
857, And he liked being in that position of being able to teach people something what he believed was teaching them something,4083.1800000000003,4089.02,23,Mike_Tyson
858," He knew so much about the human mind. Well, he's well when he died. This is very interesting",4089.26,4093.98,24,Mike_Tyson
859, We went died and then the commis was um,4094.38,4096.54,12,Mike_Tyson
860, That I lived with him and Camille and,4097.66,4099.66,11,Mike_Tyson
861, And she'd be going out with clean the room and when I saw this room I said all books about psychiatry in the mind and everything and mystic stuff and all that stuff,4099.66,4108.62,38,Mike_Tyson
862, And I said this is what he was really about,4109.099999999999,4111.099999999999,12,Mike_Tyson
863," Um, yeah, he just like he believed with mystic believers as well. He believed in then and art of",4111.82,4117.66,25,Mike_Tyson
864, Archery and all this he had those books. He was just a believer and more than what we saw,4118.46,4123.58,23,Mike_Tyson
865," Yeah, you know, it was more than what we",4124.22,4126.0599999999995,13,Mike_Tyson
866, could physically,4126.14,4127.660000000001,4,Mike_Tyson
867, Elite articulate going on without the thing and beings or what we are called,4127.660000000001,4132.22,16,Mike_Tyson
868, When you sit back and you think about your career and how fortunate you were to run into that guy,4133.1,4137.5,22,Mike_Tyson
869, I mean how much of that play a part in your mind like when you knocked out Trevor Burbick became the youngest ever,4137.900000000001,4144.06,27,Mike_Tyson
870, Heavyweight champion when you think about that we did you ever stop and think like man,4144.14,4148.38,19,Mike_Tyson
871," How lucky am I that I ran into that man? No, no, he said he's coming with me. He's summoned you",4149.02,4154.38,29,Mike_Tyson
872, Well,4155.18,4157.18,3,Mike_Tyson
873, Make sense I mean you think about a man whose life work involved,4159.18,4164.14,15,Mike_Tyson
874, Psychiatry involved the mind boxing hypnosis training all these boxers Floyd Patterson how do these great fighters?,4164.38,4171.42,25,Mike_Tyson
875, And then he wants one great one before it's over,4172.14,4176.06,13,Mike_Tyson
876," No, he's not in the animal",4176.06,4178.06,10,Mike_Tyson
877, He summoned you,4181.74,4183.74,5,Mike_Tyson
878, Wouldn't that feel like for you?,4184.78,4186.78,10,Mike_Tyson
879," Does it make sense? No, I believe what he told me yeah",4187.42,4190.22,16,Mike_Tyson
880," It I mean, I don't know if I believe you could summon someone",4192.7,4196.38,17,Mike_Tyson
881, But god damn that seems like it's real. Yeah,4197.02,4199.5,13,Mike_Tyson
882, That seems like it's real. I don't know. I think you could do whatever you believe you can do,4200.54,4204.3,25,Mike_Tyson
883, If you really believe it. Yeah,4205.1,4207.1,9,Mike_Tyson
884, Well that,4207.58,4208.78,4,Mike_Tyson
885, That was what I got out of,4208.78,4211.18,9,Mike_Tyson
886, All the things that I read about you and him together and being able to talk to you about you and him is that he,4211.740000000001,4217.26,27,Mike_Tyson
887, He gave you these tools to understand the way your mind work and you just ran with them,4217.9800000000005,4222.700000000001,20,Mike_Tyson
888," Um, I'm an extreme kind of person. Yeah, so I get carried away",4223.42,4227.58,19,Mike_Tyson
889, If your confidence in that of,4228.780000000001,4230.780000000001,8,Mike_Tyson
890," And uh, a delusional perspective you have to make confidence. Yeah",4231.58,4235.900000000001,17,Mike_Tyson
891, You get so amped up Mike,4237.02,4238.62,9,Mike_Tyson
892, You mean even even he's sitting here talking to you about these things. I could see it in you,4238.7,4241.9,23,Mike_Tyson
893, You get amped up even just talking about achieving things talking about success talking about the mind,4242.46,4248.46,20,Mike_Tyson
894," You know, I could see it inside you you get very fired up about these things",4248.86,4251.98,19,Mike_Tyson
895," Yeah, um, I have to be seriously",4252.86,4255.5,11,Mike_Tyson
896," Yeah, that intensity is what made you special. I mean that that I mean do I can't have people",4258.7,4264.46,24,Mike_Tyson
897, This is the first time I have my wife and kids around me. I'm normally this can't happen have to be away from them,4264.46,4269.26,29,Mike_Tyson
898," For camp. Yeah, yeah, no, I can tell man. You're different right now than the last time I saw you",4270.14,4275.5,28,Mike_Tyson
899," I could tell you ramping up for this fight. Yeah, it's just it's just what it is. I don't I don't know if I like being who I am",4275.5,4281.82,39,Mike_Tyson
900, It's just it's who I am. Are you planning on doing this and then seeing whether or not you're cool with it after it's over and then,4281.82,4289.58,34,Mike_Tyson
901, Maybe going back to the way you were or I just want to do it. You just want to do it,4290.46,4294.3,24,Mike_Tyson
902," Yeah, let's just do it. Only think about that for now and then let all the chips fall where they may after it's over",4294.46,4299.26,30,Mike_Tyson
903, I guess do it. I just want to do it. I like doing it. I don't think it will be the disasterism nothing this to be awesome. I'm gonna do it,4300.22,4307.18,40,Mike_Tyson
904, I'm so glad you're doing it man. There's a lot of people that had negative opinions about it and I was like listen,4307.9800000000005,4313.5,29,Mike_Tyson
905," No, this is interesting. Okay, let's think about it",4313.9,4317.02,15,Mike_Tyson
906," Hold on. We're not at all. I'm 53. I'm a year younger than you. Yeah, but listen to fact is like",4317.74,4322.54,31,Mike_Tyson

909, But what they're gonna say what happens,4332.3,4334.3,10,Mike_Tyson
910, I think there's a difference in today than there was in 20 years ago when you were dealing with a 54 year old person when it's talking,4335.5,4342.94,31,Mike_Tyson
911, When you talk about recovery when sports science what they know about how to make the body work,4342.94,4347.82,20,Mike_Tyson
912," What they know about training and conditioning people are just different now. Yeah, but it",4348.22,4352.38,19,Mike_Tyson
913, Alls have to do you could be in this is so many steroids and pills or whatever they got health roles and all that stuff,4352.54,4359.18,28,Mike_Tyson
914, But listen you could be the best physical shape me right if you don't go out there,4359.9,4364.22,20,Mike_Tyson

1011," Well, we're being fucked in this country because they keep that shit from us and they make it illegal and so many people have learned great things about themselves",4798.14,4805.18,33,Mike_Tyson
1012, Through mushrooms and through all kinds of different psychedelics especially microdose,4805.660000000001,4810.540000000001,16,Mike_Tyson
1013," They learned how to stop us from drinking. Yeah, yeah, yeah",4810.62,4813.98,16,Mike_Tyson

1015, I think you're using it since the beginning of time. We yes people like us. We abuse them. Yeah,4821.42,4826.78,25,Mike_Tyson
1016, But people abuse everything they abuse cheeseburgers and alcohol,4826.78,4829.74,13,Mike_Tyson
1017, It does you should be able to take whatever you want as a grown man and there's the the fact that this country keeps it from us and and keeps it illegal,4829.82,4837.18,35,Mike_Tyson
1018, It's fucked up because it could benefit so many people I think well,4837.26,4840.3,16,Mike_Tyson
1019, We benefit the better they wanted to benefit the people who's hiding the from us,4840.3,4843.740000000001,18,Mike_Tyson
1020, I don't want to get in benefit. I think the people that are hiding from us. They're protected pharmaceutical companies,4844.22,4849.34,26,Mike_Tyson
1021," Well, I don't know who they are, but I know they're somebody. Yeah",4849.58,4852.780000000001,20,Mike_Tyson
1022," Yeah, well, there's a lot of factors. There's a lot of factors",4853.34,4856.3,19,Mike_Tyson
1023, But for me personally and for a lot of people that I know they've gained great benefits from psychedelics,4856.38,4862.54,23,Mike_Tyson
1024, They think about this world we live in. What do you think about how did it ever exist? How did what is the origin of it? Yeah,4862.62,4870.94,32,Mike_Tyson
1025," Yeah, the world is a strange place and stranger right now because of covid and because everyone's locked down and the society's kind of fucked up",4872.14,4879.0199999999995,31,Mike_Tyson
1026, And I think we as human beings what we are who we have whatever we exist to be we're fucking germs and we're the cause of everything that happens to us like,4879.1,4886.38,36,Mike_Tyson
1027, I always think that people let out the virus like we're viruses,4886.7,4890.38,15,Mike_Tyson
1028, We're fungus. That's what we are fungus. If we look at it from a,4890.86,4894.22,20,Mike_Tyson
1029, Oh,4894.86,4895.82,3,Mike_Tyson
1030, You know the perspective of consciousness. What do we do? We get sick. We get other people sick and we die,4895.82,4900.7,26,Mike_Tyson
1031, Yeah,4901.42,4902.54,3,Mike_Tyson
1032, Have you ever heard a Terrence McKenna? You know Terrence McKenna's no tell me about parents,4902.54,4906.62,26,Mike_Tyson
1033, Terrence McKenna was a brilliant ethno botanist he was a guy that worked with plants and he was into psychedelics,4906.7,4912.3,29,Mike_Tyson
1034, And he had a theory called the stone to ape theory and he believed that human beings became human beings because of psychedelics,4912.38,4918.54,26,Mike_Tyson
1035, He thinks that we developed into human beings when lower hominids like ancient man was experimenting with mushrooms,4918.94,4926.06,22,Mike_Tyson
1036," That could be interesting. So I think um well, let me not think that let me tell you I'm so um",4926.14,4930.94,26,Mike_Tyson
1037, I thought documentaries and from the documentary,4932.54,4935.58,9,Mike_Tyson
1038, It appears to be that um the world was created off of drugs,4936.06,4939.1,15,Mike_Tyson
1039, someone's taking some drugs and they've reached in that,4939.82,4942.38,13,Mike_Tyson
1040, That believed to be um the vine intervention from God and um this is how the world was discovered if you ever,4943.18,4950.54,24,Mike_Tyson
1041," Do some research in the history of drugs. Yeah, I've definitely done some research in the history of drugs",4951.26,4955.58,24,Mike_Tyson
1042," Also, I'm sure you understand. Yeah",4955.74,4957.74,11,Mike_Tyson
1043," Well drugs and human beings we for sure it accelerates creativity, right?",4958.38,4962.38,17,Mike_Tyson
1044, It gives people ideas,4962.38,4963.74,6,Mike_Tyson
1045, But the idea behind psilocybin is a bunch of ideas one of them is that it actually,4963.74,4967.66,22,Mike_Tyson
1046, Can make people think about things like language and that language could have come about,4968.22,4973.82,17,Mike_Tyson
1047, From people making these connections from psilocybin it also makes people a little bit more creative,4974.38,4978.94,21,Mike_Tyson
1048, Makes people horny,4979.26,4980.7,6,Mike_Tyson
1049, Increases visual acuity maybe I'm compassionate. Make some compassionate,4980.7,4984.62,15,Mike_Tyson

1051," Yeah, I have the love and point as long as well",4989.0199999999995,4991.099999999999,14,Mike_Tyson
1052, And if you think about it for a long periods of time if that became a part of the human diet,4991.26,4994.78,23,Mike_Tyson
1053, And it would make sense that now it makes it because the diet has always been abused,4995.34,4999.66,19,Mike_Tyson
1054," I died as being abused now because that's why we have to be sure now, but and that's what happens with all these",4999.66,5005.0199999999995,28,Mike_Tyson
1055, Yeah extreme drugs and alternative drugs we abuse them we take too much we should be smoked too much weed,5005.98,5011.98,22,Mike_Tyson
1056," Well, you know, we smoked too much weed we smoked too many cities. We have to do too much of everything",5012.62,5017.099999999999,26,Mike_Tyson
1057," Yeah, we do abuse shit. Yeah, why do you think that is why do you think people do you think but don't you think that that same",5017.259999999999,5023.179999999999,33,Mike_Tyson
1058, Abuse that same like that's also what makes people great at things to,5023.5,5027.66,17,Mike_Tyson
1059, Because that same almost the same mindset that allows someone to abuse drugs or abuse gambling and become obsessed with pornography,5028.22,5035.18,23,Mike_Tyson
1060, Also is the same mindset if channeled the right way that allows someone to become obsessed with boxing,5035.66,5041.68,21,Mike_Tyson
1061, What's it from doing the right thing from the wrong thing with the same feeling?,5042.38,5047.62,19,Mike_Tyson
1062, What's that emotional intelligence yes,5047.66,5050.780000000001,8,Mike_Tyson
1063," The majority of the world don't even put it that the world the world is not even 50 years old, right?",5050.78,5056.34,26,Mike_Tyson

1067," Yeah, that's no true words have ever been said. That's what it is. It's emotional intelligence",5069.179999999999,5073.5,24,Mike_Tyson
1068," Good listen, I feel that slave by emotion that I'm emotional and slave by our feelings and sometimes we",5073.5,5080.78,23,Mike_Tyson
1069, Sort of placate those emotions by drowning it in food or in booze or in gambling or sex or anything that can distract you then we turn that,5081.66,5091.18,32,Mike_Tyson
1070," And to memories yeah, and then we become a slave to our memories and never stops right?",5092.7,5098.18,21,Mike_Tyson
1071, We that's who we are we are an alcohol,5098.18,5100.54,12,Mike_Tyson

1076, That's why it's so hard for people because they have a memory of all the things they done,5114.46,5118.0199999999995,22,Mike_Tyson
1077, That's wrong and they do it all the time and that becomes who they think they are,5118.0199999999995,5121.66,20,Mike_Tyson

1113, Some people call that fat shaming but I think fat shaming works for me works for me too,5308.4,5313.879999999999,22,Mike_Tyson
1114, I want somebody else to mind now you know that me and I found out he that's and he thought that was a fat,5313.879999999999,5319.599999999999,27,Mike_Tyson

1119, So you do the DMT trip and then you have it in your head like I got a jet in shape,5340.56,5345.64,24,Mike_Tyson
1120, Absolutely,5346.32,5347.68,3,Mike_Tyson
1121, Like sometimes you say like body shaming doesn't hurt people hurt some people to me it makes me hey,5347.68,5354.12,23,Mike_Tyson
1122," Man, let me it helps me that's the kind of that guy",5354.12,5356.96,16,Mike_Tyson
1123, The only way it hurts people is if you don't listen,5356.96,5359.400000000001,14,Mike_Tyson
1124," If someone says you're fat and then it hurts your feelings, but you don't work out then it hurts you",5359.759999999999,5364.44,25,Mike_Tyson
1125, But if someone says you're fat and it hurts your feelings and you say I'm gonna use this as a motivator,5364.44,5368.2,26,Mike_Tyson
1126, You're actually a bad shape then it helps you exactly fat shaming is only bad if you don't stop,5368.2,5373.719999999999,24,Mike_Tyson
1127," Yeah, I never looked at it fat shaming",5373.719999999999,5376.2,12,Mike_Tyson
1128, Like when you just what you said like who's gonna say at the mic like I don't respect that guy. Yeah,5376.2,5381.0,26,Mike_Tyson
1129," The guy that thinks like that. I'm not gonna tell him. Oh, I'm that's my enemy right. He's not helping you",5381.5599999999995,5386.799999999999,31,Mike_Tyson
1130," He's my enemy right. He's my enemy. So the DMT trip open your eyes to that. Yeah, absolutely",5386.8,5394.08,27,Mike_Tyson
1131," Yeah, but that's not something you want to do on your camp, you know, I did a 16 times",5394.64,5400.84,25,Mike_Tyson
1132," Yeah, everything 16 times yeah, never regret doing it",5401.360000000001,5405.08,13,Mike_Tyson
1133, Never regret doing,5406.24,5408.24,5,Mike_Tyson
1134, I think everybody should do it. It's just,5408.24,5410.56,12,Mike_Tyson
1135," Everybody but everybody wants to yeah, yeah, for everybody not everybody",5410.96,5415.2,15,Mike_Tyson
1136, Everybody who needs it should do it. I should say that yeah because some people believe this is all this is the real world,5415.76,5420.88,27,Mike_Tyson
1137," Yeah, they really believe this is the reality",5421.36,5423.679999999999,11,Mike_Tyson
1138, Is not interesting like once you do it you realize that that world is somewhere vivid than this world and,5424.48,5429.92,22,Mike_Tyson
1139, We're gonna be in that world longer than we're gonna be in this world,5431.12,5433.599999999999,18,Mike_Tyson
1140," How about there? Let me rip and die get this shit. Oh, yeah, that's probably true",5436.8,5441.36,23,Mike_Tyson
1141," I don't know what it is, but it's probably true, but this will listen. This is what happened you do this to stuff or any of those um",5441.759999999999,5447.679999999999,35,Mike_Tyson
1142, interesting,5448.639999999999,5450.16,3,Mike_Tyson
1143, narcotics,5450.16,5452.16,4,Mike_Tyson
1144," You have a different opinion about dying and the fear of dying yeah, you know, you say you thought the thing",5452.639999999999,5458.24,25,Mike_Tyson
1145," Hey, maybe I'm living too long",5458.24,5460.24,10,Mike_Tyson
1146," You know shit. Well, maybe that's just another existence",5460.48,5464.4,14,Mike_Tyson
1147, That's that's what what made me think like maybe this is always there and maybe this life that we have that this temporary life,5465.04,5471.28,28,Mike_Tyson
1148, We're cleaning on to that so I'm why don't why why why is it even a guy that he's why nobody wants to really,5471.28,5476.24,30,Mike_Tyson
1149, Stick on to the fact that after we die is over. Why nobody want to hold on to that,5476.88,5481.12,22,Mike_Tyson
1150," Yeah, the same way it's that more it's then really being confident with saying hey, there's something else after this",5481.679999999999,5487.04,27,Mike_Tyson
1151, And that's from scameless from dying the early or what you know,5487.759999999999,5491.2,17,Mike_Tyson
1152, Why do people stick with that and that's a smooth and that's a soft and I ride to the internal life of darkness or what it might be,5491.44,5498.16,32,Mike_Tyson
1153," I mean, we don't know until we die, right? Yeah",5498.24,5500.5599999999995,16,Mike_Tyson
1154, But the everybody think the people to think that it's just over when you die. It's over you the world,5501.44,5506.88,25,Mike_Tyson
1155, Darkness and then that's it that might be right,5507.679999999999,5510.48,12,Mike_Tyson
1156, Or it might be that you go to that place where you go when you smoke DMT,5511.28,5514.719999999999,20,Mike_Tyson
1157, Maybe that that might be you don't remember when you were born do you?,5515.12,5518.5599999999995,18,Mike_Tyson
1158," You know, you know, I got a memory you died. Yeah, I think we're born again if we're born again",5519.28,5523.44,28,Mike_Tyson
1159," And I can remember the life we had no remember this shit. Oh, I've always said everybody's scared to die, but no one's scared to sleep",5523.44,5529.44,34,Mike_Tyson
1160," You know sleep. It's no weird. Some people are yeah, some people are afraid to sleep",5530.4,5534.48,22,Mike_Tyson
1161, You know they get their moments with some time you think way I might not wake up this morning,5535.2,5539.12,21,Mike_Tyson
1162, You you're hearing you know people your school sleep. I have been a nice time with you then doing these drugs in the air throwing wake up,5539.679999999999,5545.36,31,Mike_Tyson
1163," That's true, too",5545.919999999999,5547.36,7,Mike_Tyson
1164, But the thing about sleep is you're pretty confident you're gonna come back so you're willing to shut off,5547.36,5551.839999999999,24,Mike_Tyson
1165," It's okay, but no one wants to shut off forever, but I'm listening the belief that you're gonna come back is magnificent",5552.0,5558.24,29,Mike_Tyson
1166," Yeah, the belief to know that we're gonna wake up in the morning magic. We went into life like that. Yeah, with that belief. Yeah",5558.4,5564.719999999999,33,Mike_Tyson
1167, And you think life is just temporary and,5566.0,5568.96,10,Mike_Tyson
1168, Then when it's over you're gonna go to it even more magnificent place,5569.679999999999,5573.44,17,Mike_Tyson
1169," Well, we say life what life when we that's not life is not over right when we leave this place right",5573.5199999999995,5578.719999999999,25,Mike_Tyson
1170," It's another form of life. We haven't experienced yet, right",5579.28,5581.92,16,Mike_Tyson
1171, Even if it's the black life where it's just all darkness is a part of life that we have to embrace in some kind of form of fashion,5582.56,5589.04,32,Mike_Tyson
1172," Well, that's the weird thing about the toad right is that there's no visions",5589.2,5591.76,20,Mike_Tyson
1173," But the but the feeling so intense you see yeah, right? Yeah feeling so intense even make up or whatever you see if from that's why feeling",5592.24,5600.16,32,Mike_Tyson
1174, The song point we have to understand the,5600.16,5602.24,10,Mike_Tyson
1175, Feeling the eye we have to understand the even lie to us right our eyes lie to us,5603.52,5608.96,20,Mike_Tyson
1176, I remember the first thing I felt is so insignificant,5609.92,5613.2,12,Mike_Tyson
1177, Like you're just a part of everything you're part of the whole universe and instead of looking at yourself as a center of the universe,5613.84,5619.6,29,Mike_Tyson
1178," When I did it, I just made me realize like no, you're part of this infinite thing and such a small part",5619.92,5625.36,27,Mike_Tyson
1179, Everyone is such a small part,5626.0,5628.0,8,Mike_Tyson
1180, The universe itself is what's big and you're just a piece of it,5628.4,5632.08,17,Mike_Tyson
1181, We all just feed each other,5632.32,5633.84,8,Mike_Tyson
1182," Yeah, we're all your feet me to that blood",5633.84,5636.08,13,Mike_Tyson
1183, Just running to each other feed to the whole the dirt the mud everything the water the ocean the air,5636.16,5641.36,22,Mike_Tyson

1190," Hmm if that's what you hit me with Adam and Eve. Yeah, I'm gonna go with these alien guys",5668.88,5673.12,25,Mike_Tyson
1191," Well, there's a lot of people that believe that we're the product of aliens that aliens came down and did some experience",5676.0,5682.0,27,Mike_Tyson
1192, Experiments with lower hominids and did some accelerated genetic experiments and created people well listen,5682.4800000000005,5689.0,20,Mike_Tyson
1193, Aliens of listen when,5691.12,5693.12,7,Mike_Tyson

1196, An Asian man saw a Caucasian and I was the alien a black man saw a Asian man a white man. That was the alien. Yep,5705.68,5711.599999999999,31,Mike_Tyson
1197, Um,5712.8,5713.76,3,Mike_Tyson
1198," Maybe they want aliens, but that what they thought they were there was just a tribe of people that encountered them and perhaps they were getting extinct",5713.76,5721.12,30,Mike_Tyson
1199, They were dying and they had to um,5721.12,5722.5599999999995,10,Mike_Tyson
1200, Read through just the low or whatever you were saying lower hominids lower hominids,5723.44,5728.16,20,Mike_Tyson
1201, And maybe that this is us because they they had certain um as you may know because I know you know you do these kind of researchers,5728.64,5735.28,29,Mike_Tyson
1202, They already discovered there was um there were different forms of species that that's working down to us,5735.92,5741.5199999999995,21,Mike_Tyson
1203, That they came from us and now we're at the degree of I guess where the human species is right?,5741.76,5746.8,24,Mike_Tyson
1204," Yeah, there was a bunch of different kinds of humans. Yeah, yeah, there was many many different kinds of humans and before they were here",5746.88,5752.56,31,Mike_Tyson
1205, Many of the years,5754.24,5756.24,6,Mike_Tyson
1206, before many of the years,5756.320000000001,5758.320000000001,7,Mike_Tyson

1348," I'm gonna think it's weird. Um, I think their mothers were the first especially Alexander the Great",6344.4800000000005,6348.56,23,Mike_Tyson
1349, I think she was the first stage mother. I think they were from before her too,6348.88,6352.8,19,Mike_Tyson
1350, You know,6353.92,6355.92,4,Mike_Tyson
1351, Clear patch it was what that's just what the word at the end of the day,6356.0,6359.200000000001,19,Mike_Tyson
1352," They were wanted to lead through their sons on the authority to something like that. Oh, okay",6359.52,6364.8,21,Mike_Tyson
1353, Like like that parent that takes their kids to athletic events and screams and cheers and pumps them up and,6366.400000000001,6372.56,22,Mike_Tyson
1354," No, no, no, no, it's the parent who",6372.96,6376.240000000001,15,Mike_Tyson
1355, Who's child,6377.2,6379.2,5,Mike_Tyson
1356, is law and I want to be able to have that word,6379.2,6382.5599999999995,14,Mike_Tyson
1357," Mm-hmm, okay, do you get that yeah my son is the king right this country a couple of countries",6383.2,6389.28,25,Mike_Tyson
1358, But I want I want my thought to be in his mind come out of his mouth,6390.0,6393.679999999999,19,Mike_Tyson
1359, Do you think the parents convinced the child that they were that special that they should run the world?,6393.76,6398.32,22,Mike_Tyson
1360, Some of them do but as some kids get older like I've been the great I've been the terrible,6399.36,6403.36,23,Mike_Tyson
1361, They get older and then they realize these people weren't right to me,6403.5199999999995,6406.24,16,Mike_Tyson
1362, Not and he's not killing his sponsors or the people that would rip it step parents and stuff,6406.24,6410.639999999999,21,Mike_Tyson
1363," You know some of the kings did it too, you know",6411.2,6413.36,14,Mike_Tyson
1364, So when when you were studying this when you were coming up as a boxer and you're studying all these conquerors,6414.08,6419.12,25,Mike_Tyson
1365," You were trying to understand their mindsets. Yeah, and you were trying to apply that to your own life",6419.759999999999,6424.48,24,Mike_Tyson
1366," Pretty much. Yeah, did you get anything out of it? Yeah, yeah",6425.2,6429.5199999999995,18,Mike_Tyson
1367, What did what did you get like what how did it apply to your own life? Well at the end of the day the allex God for forgiveness,6430.400000000001,6436.240000000001,32,Mike_Tyson
1368, all of it,6437.68,6439.68,5,Mike_Tyson
1369, So when you read all these books about all these conquerors when you're a young man and you're on your way to become in the youngest ever heavyweight champion,6442.64,6449.280000000001,35,Mike_Tyson
1370," And you you're trying to take on the mindset of the conquerors and you find out they all has God for forgiveness. Yeah, how did that affect you",6450.240000000001,6456.56,34,Mike_Tyson
1371, That was pretty cool,6457.4400000000005,6459.4400000000005,6,Mike_Tyson
1372, Because by that I learned greatness was the willingness to die,6459.76,6464.160000000001,13,Mike_Tyson
1373, But you know doing research and on these particular individuals and that's what they were willing to do for greatness,6465.76,6472.080000000001,23,Mike_Tyson
1374, Hmm and you you know you heard about Achilles and stuff. He said he what did he want a short life of,6474.080000000001,6481.120000000001,26,Mike_Tyson
1375," Of greatness in this a long life of obscurity. Yeah, we took the short life and that's what I'll examine it",6482.72,6489.4400000000005,28,Mike_Tyson
1376, When,6489.68,6491.68,3,Mike_Tyson
1377, When you when you study these people and you,6491.68,6494.400000000001,11,Mike_Tyson
1378, You you take that conquerors mindset,6495.4400000000005,6498.56,9,Mike_Tyson
