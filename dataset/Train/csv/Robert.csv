290," I don't know if you ever saw him, he received some award",831.84,833.84,16,Robert
291, and he was on a panel and sitting in front of podium rather.,834.6400000000001,838.5600000000001,16,Robert
292, And he was talking about Bill Cosby and he was doing this routine,838.7199999999999,841.92,16,Robert
293, about them taking away Bill Cosby's awards.,841.92,844.0,12,Robert
294," Oh, God.",844.0,844.4,6,Robert
295, And it was fucking brilliant.,844.4,845.68,8,Robert
296, And the timing was so good.,845.68,846.9599999999999,9,Robert
297, And all of us,846.9599999999999,847.68,6,Robert

300, Yes.,854.8,855.04,4,Robert
301, And but it would be different.,856.3199999999999,857.92,9,Robert
302, It'd be different.,857.92,858.4,7,Robert
303, He's a different human.,858.4,859.1999999999999,8,Robert
304," You know, this one of the more interesting things about it.",859.68,861.52,15,Robert
305, It's him talking about some of the more homophobic stuff,861.52,864.4799999999999,15,Robert
306, that he did in the past.,864.4799999999999,865.4399999999999,9,Robert
307, Now it makes him cringe and you just can't believe,865.4399999999999,867.8399999999999,13,Robert
308, he was that person.,867.9200000000001,868.72,7,Robert
309," But he, you know, he was, when he did delirious,",868.72,870.88,18,Robert
310, I think he was like 22 or something crazy like that.,870.88,873.84,14,Robert
311, Which is just bonkers.,874.8000000000001,876.08,8,Robert
312, So he was that good.,876.08,876.96,8,Robert
313," Anyway, I've been thinking about him lately in relation to a bunch of things,",877.6,881.9200000000001,19,Robert
314," but also just that particularly nowadays,",881.9200000000001,886.1600000000001,9,Robert
315," giving yourself permission to not have to jump because, you know,",886.1600000000001,892.4000000000001,15,Robert
316, strike the iron's hot.,892.4000000000001,894.32,8,Robert
317, All that stuff.,894.32,895.12,6,Robert
318," And maybe it's just as a bit of an anxiety to the times,",895.84,898.5600000000001,17,Robert
319," which I remember too, speaking of past generations.",898.5600000000001,901.36,12,Robert

325," It's different, but now it's on us.",915.52,917.84,13,Robert
326, So there's the bit of urgency.,918.5600000000001,920.48,10,Robert
327," And that whole thing of just being able to say,",921.28,923.44,13,Robert
328," like so to answer your question, to me,",923.44,925.0400000000001,12,Robert
329, starting up again is off the table.,927.12,928.5600000000001,10,Robert
330, I feel I've done all I could with that character.,928.5600000000001,930.32,14,Robert
331, There'd have to be a super compelling argument,931.12,934.72,11,Robert
332, in a series of events that made it obvious to it.,934.72,939.12,14,Robert
333," But the other thing is, I want to do other stuff.",939.12,941.12,15,Robert
334," Right, of course.",941.12,942.1600000000001,7,Robert

337, People can lose themselves in current events.,947.2,949.6800000000001,10,Robert
338," And what I mean by that, like, it doesn't necessarily",949.6800000000001,952.32,15,Robert
339," completely, your life is more than what's going on in Washington.",952.4000000000001,956.72,16,Robert

344, How much does that affect your day-to-day existence?,969.44,972.0,15,Robert
345, It's very little.,972.0,973.0400000000001,7,Robert
346," But for some people, it becomes an enormous portion of the real state of their mind.",973.0400000000001,979.7600000000001,20,Robert
347," It takes over most of their day-to-day consciousness,",979.76,984.24,15,Robert
348, where they're consumed with it.,984.24,986.08,9,Robert
349," And it becomes a thing they're cheering for, or they're rooting against.",986.08,990.08,18,Robert
350," And then, you know, your life revolves on something that you have very little power over.",990.64,996.08,21,Robert

369, rock solid idea of what's going on.,1046.8799999999999,1049.76,11,Robert
370, His was more trying to have enough things going on that I wouldn't have any ideas for a year.,1050.08,1055.12,23,Robert

383, It was different.,1078.8,1079.44,6,Robert
384, Yeah.,1079.44,1079.92,4,Robert
385," There was an edge to it, you know?",1079.92,1081.6,12,Robert
386," He's, he added crazy.",1082.32,1084.6399999999999,9,Robert
387, He added crazy to this beautiful harmony.,1084.6399999999999,1086.8799999999999,10,Robert
388, And I love it when the guys that added crazy go up to the thin veil,1086.8799999999999,1092.24,18,Robert
389," between dimensions and say, I think I'm going to stay put.",1092.24,1096.72,16,Robert
390, Yeah.,1096.8,1097.28,4,Robert
391, And then all of a sudden they represent,1097.28,1099.92,10,Robert
392, stability.,1103.04,1103.84,4,Robert
393," They represent being okay, hanging up your guns.",1103.84,1109.44,12,Robert
394, Yeah.,1109.44,1109.92,4,Robert
395," And just being, you know, free.",1109.92,1113.68,11,Robert
396, That's everything.,1113.68,1114.72,6,Robert
397," Everyone has to accept that at some point in time, right?",1114.72,1117.28,15,Robert
398," I mean, maybe that's you and your glasses, right?",1117.28,1119.28,15,Robert
399, Yeah.,1119.28,1119.52,4,Robert
400, Because everyone has to accept that at one point in time.,1119.52,1121.6000000000001,14,Robert
401, You're going to have to get off the ride.,1121.6000000000001,1122.8,13,Robert
402, But when you're doing great and you're kicking it like,1122.8,1125.76,14,Robert
403, boxers are a perfect example.,1125.76,1127.6,9,Robert
404, They always last too long.,1127.6,1129.52,8,Robert
405, There's only been a small handful.,1129.52,1131.6,10,Robert
406," Like Andre Ward, recently, marvelous Marvin Hagler in his prime,",1131.6,1135.04,16,Robert
407," they just go, that's it.",1135.04,1136.4,10,Robert
408, I'm done.,1136.4,1136.8799999999999,6,Robert
409, And they actually are done.,1136.8799999999999,1138.4,8,Robert
410, Almost every one of them comes back and almost every one of them,1138.4,1140.96,15,Robert
411, chases that dragon.,1140.96,1142.16,7,Robert
412, Here's why I love you.,1142.16,1143.52,9,Robert
413, You're making an argument for,1143.52,1145.28,8,Robert
414, and also the argument against me coming back and doing another.,1145.28,1148.4,14,Robert
415, Yeah.,1148.4,1148.8799999999999,4,Robert
416," Listen, I'm not married to anything except my wife.",1148.8799999999999,1151.84,14,Robert
417, But I'm not married to any ideas.,1151.84,1153.52,11,Robert
418," All the ideas that I have are just like,",1153.52,1155.28,12,Robert
419," hmm, maybe that idea sucks.",1155.28,1157.52,9,Robert
420, I love you as Iron Man.,1157.52,1159.52,9,Robert
421," So I would, if they opened up this time machine",1159.52,1163.44,13,Robert
422," and you popped out, I just imagine the moment",1163.44,1166.08,12,Robert
423," where everybody goes fucking crazy, it would be amazing.",1166.08,1168.8799999999999,13,Robert
424, It could be great.,1168.8799999999999,1169.6,7,Robert
425, I would love that.,1169.6,1170.3999999999999,7,Robert
426, But I would also love you hanging it up.,1170.3999999999999,1171.92,12,Robert
427, Yeah.,1173.12,1173.84,4,Robert
428," It's, look, it's just, first of all, it's 2020.",1173.84,1177.2,19,Robert
429," And I'm not an OCD guy, but I keep thinking, see clearly.",1177.2,1181.76,19,Robert
430," See clearly, even if your vision is going.",1182.56,1184.72,12,Robert
431," And it's difficult because by, I feel like we all just get",1185.52,1189.76,16,Robert
432," buffeted by feelings and ego or fears or little, you know,",1189.76,1196.72,16,Robert
433," chips of resentments or intuitions that are tied to something maybe higher,",1196.72,1201.44,17,Robert
434, but you think is out of your reach or whatever.,1201.44,1204.48,13,Robert
435, So it was a perfect time.,1204.48,1206.16,9,Robert
436, And I got to go have dinner with a bunch of the Marvel folks last night.,1206.8799999999999,1211.04,19,Robert
437," And kind of have just a little bit of extra closure because, you know,",1211.84,1214.32,18,Robert
438, the movie came out and it was bananas and the directors are sending me pictures,1214.32,1219.52,17,Robert
439, of people flipping out in theaters when Tony snaps.,1219.52,1222.8,12,Robert
440," And I was like, whoa, this is kind of like a really big cultural thing.",1222.8,1226.8,20,Robert
441," But then like Victoria Alonzo, who's the head of VFX for all these movies,",1226.8,1231.2,22,Robert
442, a literal super genius or Kevin Feige or Favreau or Scarlet or some people,1231.2,1238.56,21,Robert
443, that I've just been there with it for a long time.,1238.56,1240.8,15,Robert
444, We were there experiencing it all when it came out.,1241.6,1246.08,13,Robert
445, And then we see each other on a red carpet and it's not intimate.,1246.08,1249.2,18,Robert
446," And then we kind of hadn't really had a chance just to do nothing,",1249.2,1253.04,18,Robert
447," just hang out and, you know, have some crudite and kind of talk shit.",1253.04,1257.12,21,Robert
448," So it was really interesting being here today because yesterday was this kind of last night,",1257.76,1262.6399999999999,19,Robert
449, was this kind of real like closing the circle on things a bit.,1262.6399999999999,1265.68,16,Robert
450, That's got to be bittersweet.,1266.32,1267.6,11,Robert
451, Yeah.,1268.56,1269.76,4,Robert
452, But I like that you want to move on.,1269.76,1272.48,12,Robert
453," And I like that you want to, and I like that you're doing something like Dr. Doodle.",1273.12,1277.04,24,Robert
454," Because that's like, you've done a lot of wild shit in your life.",1277.04,1281.36,19,Robert
455, You've got a lot of wild shit in your career.,1281.36,1283.28,14,Robert
456," But you sort of embody every new chapter with the same kind of energy,",1283.28,1290.1599999999999,17,Robert
457, although there's a different result and a different piece of art.,1290.1599999999999,1292.6399999999999,15,Robert
458, It's all the same you.,1292.6399999999999,1294.08,9,Robert
459, And that's one of the more interesting things about people.,1294.7199999999998,1297.28,14,Robert
460, And particular actors because actors get to be a bunch of different things.,1297.36,1302.08,16,Robert
461, And it's one of the weirder things about that craft.,1302.08,1304.96,16,Robert
462," Like when you see a guy who's like Daniel De Lewis,",1304.96,1308.8,15,Robert
463," who like embodies these different humans, like literally becomes different humans.",1308.8,1313.12,16,Robert
464," It's, but it's always Daniel De Lewis.",1313.6,1316.08,13,Robert
465, You know what I mean?,1316.3999999999999,1316.8799999999999,8,Robert
466," Like even though he plays these, these, you know,",1316.8799999999999,1319.76,14,Robert
467," that there will be blood guy and all these different psychopaths and various fascinating characters,",1319.76,1326.0,19,Robert
468," it's always the energy like you're, you're pumped to see him do it.",1326.0,1329.04,20,Robert
469," Right? And I think that's, I feel the same way with you.",1329.76,1332.16,18,Robert
470," It's like, I know there's, you're an interesting guy.",1332.16,1335.04,17,Robert
471, There's a lot of shit going on in your head.,1335.04,1337.28,14,Robert
472," So when you dive into something, whatever it is,",1337.28,1340.08,13,Robert
473," whether it's your character from Tropic Thunder or whatever it is,",1340.08,1343.44,16,Robert
474," like you're, you're gonna, it's gonna be Robert Downey Jr.",1343.44,1347.04,19,Robert
475, dive in into something.,1347.04,1347.92,7,Robert
476," So I would imagine it would be kind of annoying,",1347.92,1351.28,13,Robert
477, even though you are brilliant at Iron Man to stay Iron Man.,1351.28,1354.8,15,Robert
478, Yeah.,1356.64,1357.2,4,Robert
479," Well, fortunately, I don't have to find out.",1357.2,1360.24,14,Robert
480," Right? It's, it's just interesting too.",1360.24,1362.0,13,Robert
481," You know, life is doing something and, and, you know, I met at this place.",1362.0,1367.04,22,Robert
482," It's also, it, it baffles me confidence.",1367.76,1372.08,14,Robert
483," What is, what does it really mean?",1372.8,1374.64,11,Robert
484," There was a period of time where I felt like I did, I did the first Iron Man and then I went",1375.44,1381.12,25,Robert
485, did Tropic Thunder and then I was doing the first Sherlock and I had my shirt off and I was,1381.12,1384.56,23,Robert
486," doing martial arts. I was like, I was all over the place and it just felt like I was,",1384.56,1388.96,24,Robert
487, I was hitting triples no matter what I did.,1388.96,1390.8799999999999,13,Robert
488," And, and then people are like, are you really as confident as you seem?",1392.1599999999999,1396.0,19,Robert
489," And I was like, I guess right now I am, yeah.",1396.0,1398.1599999999999,16,Robert
490," And then, and I think this goes, I mean, this reminds me, we were just talking about the,",1399.6799999999998,1403.6799999999998,25,Robert
491," McGregor cowboy fight coming up, you know, it's like, it's,",1405.12,1409.12,20,Robert
492, you're gonna go to that?,1409.84,1410.6399999999999,9,Robert
493, I'm gonna watch it.,1411.6,1412.32,8,Robert
494," I can not watch it, you know?",1412.8799999999999,1414.48,11,Robert
495," To brilliant, uh, souls who cannot lose, neither one of them can afford to lose this fight.",1414.8,1424.32,23,Robert
496," Wow, that is a matchup.",1425.12,1426.8799999999999,10,Robert
497," Yeah, particularly, cowboy doesn't want to lose.",1428.0,1430.8,13,Robert
498," Heck no, but there's this guy who's the, the, the poster child, the guy who's the, the,",1430.8,1436.72,28,Robert
499," the one, right, the chosen one, that's Connor.",1436.72,1439.44,15,Robert
500," And then there's cowboy who's like, I think I can fuck that guy up.",1439.44,1443.2,20,Robert
501, The journeyman.,1443.28,1444.0,6,Robert
502," Yeah, yeah.",1444.0,1444.8,6,Robert
503," So confidence, you know, there's been times when I felt I'm in possession of it.",1446.0,1451.52,22,Robert
504, And then you want to let go a little bit because it's only ever the moment and life,1451.52,1456.56,21,Robert
505, guiding you.,1457.92,1458.56,5,Robert
506," The wind is so at your back that you're like, wow, are you just, are you just, you know,",1458.56,1462.72,27,Robert
507, jumping over the waves and all that by yourself?,1462.72,1464.72,12,Robert
508," And you're like, you bet I am.",1464.72,1466.0,12,Robert
509," But there's a physics to the moment, man moment, machine, whatever.",1466.64,1470.48,18,Robert
510, And the winds at your back.,1471.04,1472.16,9,Robert
511, And then the wind does what the fucking windows and it changes.,1472.72,1476.72,15,Robert
512," And if you're left there thinking what, you know, so I think it's great to be in full",1477.0400000000002,1481.1200000000001,24,Robert
513, possession of what you would call supreme confidence.,1481.1200000000001,1484.4,11,Robert
514, And then see what happens if you don't hold on to it so hard because it's great.,1485.0400000000002,1489.8400000000001,22,Robert
515," But it is a bit of an illusion because like everything else, it's always changing.",1490.4,1494.48,20,Robert
516," And every day the reset button, the spacebar gets pressed and it's like, now what?",1494.48,1498.4,22,Robert
517, Yeah.,1498.96,1499.3600000000001,4,Robert
518, The reset button.,1501.2,1502.4,6,Robert
519, Yeah.,1502.4,1502.88,4,Robert
520, That you kind of have to have a confidence to jump into some of the roles that you've taken.,1503.6000000000001,1508.0,23,Robert
521," No, but I see what you're saying.",1508.0,1510.0800000000002,12,Robert
522, Like that you don't want to hold on to it.,1510.48,1511.92,14,Robert
523, Because it can come go.,1514.0,1514.96,8,Robert
524, I remember Warren Beatty who I learned so many amazing things from a student movie called,1514.96,1521.2,19,Robert
525, The Pickup Artist with Molly Ringwald.,1522.0800000000002,1524.0800000000002,11,Robert
526, I remember that movie.,1524.0800000000002,1524.8000000000002,7,Robert
527," Okay. And he was kind of the de facto producer of it, uncredited.",1524.8,1528.48,20,Robert
528, And he taught me a lot about just acting and what it was.,1529.12,1533.2,16,Robert
529," And he said, he said, what's your action in this scene?",1534.3999999999999,1536.8799999999999,17,Robert
530," And I was like, oh no, he's asking me.",1536.8799999999999,1538.3999999999999,15,Robert
531," I was like, my action.",1538.3999999999999,1540.08,9,Robert
532, I'm picking up girls.,1540.08,1541.2,8,Robert
533," He goes, what's your action in this scene?",1541.2,1543.6,13,Robert
534," And I was like, I'm driving a car.",1544.3999999999999,1546.32,13,Robert
535," And he asked me like, you know that things sometimes,",1546.32,1548.24,14,Robert
536," I'm going to ask you a question and just you get caught flat foot and you go,",1548.24,1552.08,21,Robert
537," no, your action is you're trying to go to work, but you're getting distracted",1552.08,1554.96,20,Robert
538, by this addiction you have to try to get laid.,1555.9199999999998,1560.48,13,Robert
539, So your action is you're trying to get to work.,1561.36,1564.48,14,Robert
540," And I was like, oh yeah, he's right.",1565.04,1566.1599999999999,14,Robert
541," And he said, always know what your action is because then when you come in in the morning,",1567.04,1570.8,22,Robert
542," confident or when you come in in the morning, you can't hit your ass with both hands.",1571.84,1575.1999999999998,22,Robert
543, You know what to do.,1575.1999999999998,1575.9199999999998,8,Robert
544," So to me, one of the great lessons I learned from him was, oh yeah,",1577.6799999999998,1581.28,20,Robert
545," just boil down what it is you're doing, whether there's a camera around or just what am I doing today?",1581.92,1587.68,26,Robert
546, Today I'm showing up and I'm trying to be honest and also to listen and learn.,1587.68,1597.76,21,Robert
547, But really my action today is I'm beginning a process of promotion.,1600.72,1606.0,16,Robert
548, Warren Bates is another guy who learned how to put his guns down.,1608.3999999999999,1610.72,17,Robert
549," Yeah, it's like I remember watching that Madonna movie.",1611.36,1614.96,14,Robert

556," And he's like, he's never seen it.",1624.8,1626.32,13,Robert
557," Yeah, but he's an older gentleman now, you know, he's the best.",1626.32,1628.8799999999999,20,Robert
558," And you know, he's hanging out with her and just shaking his head.",1628.8799999999999,1633.04,18,Robert
559," And you know, that kind of marked it for me.",1633.04,1635.28,14,Robert
560," Or Warren Bates just realized, all right, let me step away real quick.",1635.28,1639.04,19,Robert
561," If I had to talk to him, one thing I would ask him is,",1639.12,1641.92,18,Robert
562, what was it like when Carly Simon writes a song about you?,1641.92,1644.48,16,Robert

571, Would that be possible?,1663.68,1664.56,7,Robert
572, Or you could do it.,1665.92,1666.96,8,Robert

575, which I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen to see about a black guy who takes over an,1679.92,1685.52,21,Robert
576, added agency in the 60s because everyone votes for him when the head of the company dies because,1685.52,1692.08,21,Robert
577, they think no one else will.,1692.08,1693.2,9,Robert
578, And it's about what happens when someone who is free spirited takes over and essentially,1694.24,1698.8799999999999,19,Robert
579, corrupt endeavor.,1699.0400000000002,1700.24,5,Robert
580, And then he realizes and confronts his own corruption.,1701.1200000000001,1703.68,13,Robert
581, But I remember I was probably two or three when that was being shot and when it came out and,1704.4,1709.7600000000002,22,Robert
582, it was so a part of my upbringing.,1709.7600000000002,1712.64,11,Robert
583, And I just remembered some of the folks that were around my dad at that time.,1712.64,1716.48,19,Robert
584," And so when Ben called and said, hey, I'm doing this thing.",1716.48,1720.5600000000002,18,Robert

588, And I'll do that after Iron Man.,1728.88,1730.24,11,Robert

595, So there's something in it for me.,1747.8400000000001,1749.28,11,Robert
596, The other thing is I get to hold up to nature the insane self-involved hypocrisy of artists,1750.08,1760.6399999999999,24,Robert
597, and what they think they're allowed to do on occasion.,1760.6399999999999,1764.32,14,Robert

610," You know, I can't disagree with them, but I know where my heart was.",1804.3200000000002,1810.16,20,Robert
611, And I think that it's never an excuse to do something that is out of place and not of its time.,1810.72,1817.3600000000001,25,Robert

621," It's, it's an interesting and necessary meditation on where is the pendulum?",1850.1599999999999,1857.28,18,Robert
622, Why is the pendulum right?,1858.16,1859.84,8,Robert
623, Yeah.,1860.48,1860.8799999999999,4,Robert
624, Where is the pendulum maybe cutting a little into what could be perceived as,1860.8799999999999,1867.52,16,Robert

626," But again, I mean, you know, there's a morality clause here on this planet.",1871.84,1877.76,21,Robert
627, And it's a big price to pay.,1877.76,1879.6,11,Robert
628, And I think having a moral psychology is job one.,1879.6,1884.0,13,Robert

682," And I was like, well, here we go.",2031.1200000000001,2032.88,13,Robert
683, And I was just running.,2032.88,2034.5600000000002,8,Robert
684, I think I had six lines that day.,2034.5600000000002,2036.3200000000002,11,Robert
685, But I knew that there was going to be choppers.,2037.3600000000001,2040.0800000000002,14,Robert
686, There was going to be a squib fire.,2040.0800000000002,2042.5600000000002,12,Robert

690," again, what's my action?",2051.2799999999997,2052.64,9,Robert
691, My action is an actor in this movie is to know what I'm doing.,2052.64,2055.2,18,Robert
692, Even if what I'm doing is insane.,2055.8399999999997,2057.68,11,Robert
693, So I ran those six or eight lines.,2058.72,2060.96,11,Robert
694," I had a thousand times,",2060.96,2063.3599999999997,8,Robert

696," So the next day, I was free to enjoy myself",2067.8399999999997,2073.04,13,Robert
697, and not be struggling to wonder what it was I was supposed to be doing.,2073.04,2076.8799999999997,18,Robert
698, And then that's what it is.,2076.8799999999997,2077.8399999999997,10,Robert
699," It was just, you know,",2077.8399999999997,2079.04,9,Robert

702," Forget that it was, you know, a blackface.",2088.72,2090.56,14,Robert
703, It was special effects makeup day after day after day after day after day after day after day,2090.56,2095.7599999999998,20,Robert
704, except for the times when I would have my bleached hair and blue contacts in my eyes,2095.7599999999998,2100.08,20,Robert
705," or, you know, other characters.",2101.12,2102.8,10,Robert
706," And it was just a, it was a piece of work I was doing.",2102.8,2106.48,18,Robert
707, And I cared about doing it as professionally and as honestly as I could.,2109.04,2112.72,17,Robert
708," So when you memorize lines, that's an interesting thing.",2114.08,2116.88,14,Robert
709," You said that you were free to, to do it.",2116.88,2120.16,14,Robert
710," Like when you memorize lines, is there ever a part like when you're acting",2120.16,2124.88,18,Robert
711," where you have to think like, okay, what am I supposed to say next?",2124.88,2129.36,19,Robert
712, And how much does that get in the way?,2129.36,2130.88,12,Robert
713," This, I look, I have a very broad band of, of tolerances.",2132.0,2136.24,19,Robert
714, I don't care if the people I'm with happen to not know what they're doing or don't know,2137.12,2141.9199999999996,24,Robert
715," their lines or stepping on my lines or, or whatever, or want to change their lines and my lines.",2141.9199999999996,2147.6,24,Robert
716, And it's always a different thing.,2148.72,2151.4399999999996,10,Robert
717, It's like reading the room.,2151.4399999999996,2152.3999999999996,9,Robert
718," It's like, you know, if I was a fighter, you go into the octagon and there they go, you ready?",2152.3999999999996,2155.9199999999996,29,Robert

720, You go in.,2159.8399999999997,2160.4799999999996,6,Robert
721, But so I've had it where I would try to be off book before everyone else.,2160.4799999999996,2165.2799999999997,20,Robert
722, I would get it down to an acronym.,2165.28,2167.0400000000004,11,Robert
723," So if there was a thousand words I had to remember, I would just remember the first letter of each",2167.0400000000004,2172.2400000000002,23,Robert
724, and I would put it on a piece of poster board.,2172.2400000000002,2174.48,14,Robert
725," And then I would stand away from it, not as far as you and your, your archery setup over there.",2175.1200000000003,2180.0,26,Robert
726," But far enough away to where I can see it, but kind of can't see it.",2180.0,2182.5600000000004,21,Robert
727, Back when my vision was a little more clear.,2182.5600000000004,2184.4,12,Robert
728, And I would just run it and run it and run it.,2185.6000000000004,2187.2000000000003,15,Robert
729," When I did the first Sherlock, we were rewriting it so much.",2188.32,2191.28,17,Robert
730, And I would have pages and pages of stuff.,2191.28,2193.0400000000004,12,Robert
731," I was like, give me a near-week and it helped me with my accent.",2193.04,2195.92,20,Robert
732," And then I started getting into like, you know what's so great?",2196.96,2199.68,17,Robert
733," I can finish work, go home, hang out with my kids or do whatever I want to do, go train.",2199.68,2204.4,26,Robert
734," And in the morning, they can change it all they want.",2205.04,2207.2,15,Robert
735," I don't have to trip if it all, if you know, unless it's some monologue that you want to really",2207.2,2212.64,27,Robert
736," be committed to, that's not going to shift. I've just got like that.",2212.64,2215.68,20,Robert
737, So you'd put one of those little earpieces in and they would feed you the lot.,2215.68,2218.72,21,Robert
738, Yeah.,2218.72,2219.2,4,Robert
739, Yeah.,2219.2,2219.6,4,Robert
740, And now I've kind of gone as far as you can go with that and I'll probably go back to,2219.68,2223.8399999999997,24,Robert
741, new method or a new version of the old method.,2224.64,2226.72,13,Robert
742, So it's basically improvisational.,2227.2799999999997,2229.36,9,Robert
743," Like you in the moment, like you decide with whatever preparation you're going to do for each",2229.36,2234.08,21,Robert

745, or whether you're just going to be a little bit more loose and free with it.,2239.04,2241.7599999999998,20,Robert
746," Yes, depends on the script too.",2241.7599999999998,2243.2,10,Robert
747," Like, Tropic Thunder, Justin Thoreau wrote that script with Ben.",2243.2,2247.2,18,Robert
748," Yes, really good script.",2247.2,2248.88,8,Robert
749," I mean, my missus, who next to my mother, you know, with probably more so, is the opinion I was",2248.88,2254.32,28,Robert
750, really waiting on.,2254.32,2255.6,6,Robert
751, And she was reading in the kitchen laughing her ass off.,2256.2400000000002,2258.2400000000002,14,Robert
752," She goes, this is so wrong.",2258.2400000000002,2259.92,10,Robert
753, This is so wrong.,2261.12,2262.56,7,Robert

926," Like, when you're on the set,",2645.8399999999997,2646.88,11,Robert
927, that seems like one of the weirdest parts about acting,2647.6,2650.16,12,Robert
928, in some of those Avenger films is how much of it is actually digital.,2650.16,2653.7599999999998,18,Robert

941, because there's paint on the whole thing.,2680.3199999999997,2681.44,11,Robert
942," So, that rotoscoping is a great metaphor",2682.16,2685.68,12,Robert
943, for essentially what the Marvel movies became,2685.68,2688.72,9,Robert

957, I go great.,2720.48,2721.04,6,Robert

962," you know, paint it purple.",2728.64,2730.72,9,Robert
963, So everybody got to join in on the joys,2731.44,2735.68,12,Robert
964, and the miseries of the technical challenge of doing it.,2735.7599999999998,2740.24,14,Robert
965," And speaking of Ruffalo,",2740.24,2741.2799999999997,9,Robert
966," by the end, because he's smart Hulk,",2742.0,2744.16,12,Robert
967, he literally they're just making him big wherever he was.,2745.2,2748.24,14,Robert
968," And they put a little, you know,",2748.24,2749.9199999999996,11,Robert
969, a piece of PVC with a big Hulk head up about five feet over where his head was.,2749.9199999999996,2755.2799999999997,21,Robert
970, And he was just there in a green suit.,2755.2799999999997,2756.64,12,Robert
971," So in a tracking suit with like his package out, you know.",2758.08,2760.8799999999997,16,Robert
972," And he'd be like, can I...",2760.8799999999997,2761.7599999999998,11,Robert
973, Let me just at least tie like a little,2761.7599999999998,2763.68,11,Robert
974, so wrong around my...,2763.7599999999998,2764.7999999999997,7,Robert
975," Come on guys, whatever, you know.",2764.7999999999997,2766.64,11,Robert
976, And so I think Mark went about as far out into the ionosphere of,2767.6,2773.44,17,Robert
977, FCG as you can.,2774.24,2775.6,8,Robert
978, I didn't get the whole smart Hulk thing.,2776.48,2779.6,12,Robert
979, I didn't get how he figured that out.,2779.6,2782.24,12,Robert
980, It wasn't really.,2782.24,2782.8799999999997,7,Robert
981, Yeah.,2782.8799999999997,2783.52,4,Robert
982, Hulk is supposed to be Hulk.,2784.96,2786.3199999999997,9,Robert
983, Right.,2787.2799999999997,2787.6,4,Robert
984, It's supposed to be the altar.,2787.6,2789.2,10,Robert
985, It's like one you can control.,2789.2,2790.96,10,Robert
986, One is one of the genius scientists.,2790.96,2793.2,10,Robert
987, Exactly.,2793.2799999999997,2793.7599999999998,4,Robert
988, What is the beast?,2793.7599999999998,2794.7999999999997,7,Robert
989," But after so many times, and again, this is the genius of the people who",2794.7999999999997,2799.68,19,Robert
990," break and shake stories over there,",2799.68,2801.2,9,Robert
991," fiking his team as they go,",2801.9199999999996,2803.52,10,Robert
992," oh, he's Hulk and he's not Hulk.",2803.52,2805.04,13,Robert
993, He's Hulk.,2805.04,2805.52,6,Robert
994, It's a big battle.,2805.52,2806.3199999999997,8,Robert
995," Oh, he's so conflicted.",2806.3199999999997,2807.4399999999996,10,Robert
996, What if he could meet himself in the middle?,2808.0,2809.8399999999997,12,Robert
997, And then what corner have we painted ourselves in by having him meet himself in the middle?,2810.56,2816.3999999999996,20,Robert
998, Because then you can't...,2816.3999999999996,2817.52,8,Robert
999," If that doesn't work, you can't go back to the way it was.",2817.52,2819.68,19,Robert
1000, You've done it or you can go back to the way it was.,2819.68,2821.2799999999997,17,Robert
1001, So I just think that the real genius of the Marvel creative team is they...,2822.0,2827.28,18,Robert
1002, and the Russo Brothers who did the last few,2827.28,2829.36,12,Robert
1003," Avengers Infinity War and Endgame is they go,",2830.6400000000003,2832.6400000000003,12,Robert
1004, we love writing ourselves into a corner.,2832.6400000000003,2835.2000000000003,10,Robert
1005, We love it.,2835.2000000000003,2835.84,6,Robert
1006, Because then it activates all of those.,2836.48,2840.0,10,Robert
1007, How do we get out of purgatory juices and then you get the next right idea?,2840.0,2844.1600000000003,21,Robert
1008," Now, when you guys sit down and when you first receive a script for one of these things,",2844.96,2850.0800000000004,22,Robert
1009, do they consult with you?,2851.04,2852.96,8,Robert
1010, Do they discuss this with you?,2852.96,2854.4,9,Robert
1011," Do they just lay it out and say,",2854.4,2855.84,11,Robert
1012, this is the character arc.,2855.84,2857.68,8,Robert
1013, How do you feel about this?,2857.68,2859.2799999999997,9,Robert
1014, What do you think?,2859.2799999999997,2859.84,7,Robert
1015," Yeah, and it's changed over time.",2860.72,2862.7999999999997,11,Robert
1016," I think if you're one of the folks who has their standalone movies,",2863.7599999999998,2866.72,17,Robert
1017," like Scarlett has Black Widow coming out,",2866.72,2868.88,12,Robert
1018, I think you take a...,2868.88,2869.44,8,Robert
1019, I would.,2870.16,2870.64,5,Robert
1020, You take a bit of a different,2870.64,2872.16,9,Robert
1021, tack in how much meaning...,2874.0,2876.48,8,Robert
1022," I think the phrase, the legal phrase for actors and studios is meaningful consultation,",2876.48,2881.92,18,Robert
1023," not script approval, because then anybody could hold a studio hostage,",2882.72,2887.52,15,Robert
1024, because I don't approve this $30 million that you're trying to spend right now.,2887.52,2892.64,20,Robert
1025, So your schedule's fine.,2892.64,2893.68,8,Robert
1026," When you say, I don't approve, I picture a bathrobe and I picture fine china and tea cups.",2893.68,2898.72,25,Robert
1027, That's a picture I don't approve and then just storming off.,2898.72,2901.76,17,Robert
1028," I've had my moments too, because I'm so passionate about story.",2902.7200000000003,2906.2400000000002,17,Robert
1029," But again, after more seat time with the same people and new people coming in and getting a pretty",2907.76,2914.2400000000002,22,Robert
1030," brutal education on what kind of process these movies require, you just start trusting more",2914.2400000000002,2924.7200000000003,18,Robert
1031, that they're thinking on your behalf.,2924.7200000000003,2926.7200000000003,10,Robert
1032," And also, little things are easy to change.",2927.52,2930.3199999999997,12,Robert
1033, Big things become an inconvenience to the higher good.,2930.8799999999997,2934.48,13,Robert
1034, And at what point do you want to pull the air break on something where the trains are,2935.2,2943.12,20,Robert
1035, leaving the station?,2943.12,2944.24,6,Robert
1036," Well, I would imagine it would be a fine line.",2944.8799999999997,2947.2,14,Robert
1037, They want the actor to be comfortable with the character and they want some...,2948.24,2953.68,17,Robert
1038, and maybe some feedback would do beneficial.,2953.68,2955.9199999999996,10,Robert
1039," But they're also... they have a path, a vision that they've created.",2955.9199999999996,2959.44,19,Robert
1040," They would like to see you somehow or another, at least morph slightly to get on this path.",2959.44,2965.44,22,Robert
1041, Yeah.,2965.44,2965.68,4,Robert
1042," Yeah. And by the way, after I had my second round of kids with Susan, I became both artistically,",2966.48,2974.64,26,Robert
1043, I had a bit of a renaissance when I was doing the third Iron Man.,2974.64,2978.3199999999997,20,Robert
1044," And then after that too, I was like, well, now I'm going to do this Avengers and there's so",2978.96,2982.64,26,Robert
1045, many moving parts and it's so difficult just to get all these schedules to coincide and get,2982.64,2987.12,21,Robert
1046," everyone together, then I'm not going to be like, I'm not feeling it.",2987.12,2990.56,20,Robert
1047," So again, it's that thing.",2992.08,2993.68,10,Robert
1048, It's sometimes...,2993.68,2995.6,6,Robert
1049, What do they say?,2996.3199999999997,2997.2799999999997,7,Robert
1050, A faster or a low and further together?,2997.2799999999997,2999.2,11,Robert
1051, Sometimes you can only think about further because you got to get down field.,2999.2,3004.0,17,Robert
1052," Other times, you're thinking, hey, this is my moment to run and I need a little help and a",3004.0,3009.2,25,Robert
1053," little approval and any little leeway, but that's any creative endeavor.",3009.2,3013.12,17,Robert
1054," I would imagine when you're involved in something that's so epic, when it's actually over,",3013.12,3017.2,22,Robert
1055," it probably almost seems surreal because the production is so massive, there's so many moving",3017.2,3022.56,19,Robert
1056," pieces, there's so many special effects, so many things that you have to sort of visualize while",3022.56,3027.2799999999997,22,Robert
1057," you're doing it. And then after it's all over, you're done. And what is a big Avengers movie?",3027.2799999999997,3035.8399999999997,27,Robert
1058, How many months are you involved in this?,3035.8399999999997,3037.52,11,Robert
1059," Well, I mean, it could be some part of 18 months to two years, depending on how far out you are,",3037.68,3045.92,27,Robert
1060," and then four to six months of principal photography, and that additional photography,",3045.92,3049.92,17,Robert
1061," and then post, and then I always include promotion, you know, from...",3049.92,3053.68,18,Robert
1062, Yeah.,3053.68,3053.92,4,Robert
1063," From soup to nuts, I think, is the phrase...",3056.88,3059.7599999999998,14,Robert
1064, Soup to nuts?,3059.7599999999998,3060.8,6,Robert
1065," Yeah, that's a Jules Silver phrase, one of my great friends and",3060.8,3067.12,18,Robert
1066," probably one of the greatest big movie producers of all time. We did the Sherlocks with him,",3068.0,3074.56,22,Robert
1067," we did the Matrix series, my Mrs. was running his company for 10 years,",3074.56,3077.84,19,Robert

1069," wound up being a calling card, it came out and it bombed, but John Favreau saw it,",3083.52,3090.16,26,Robert
1070," and he said, this guy could do it action movie. And so that wound up being my calling card into",3090.16,3095.36,24,Robert
1071," the Marvel Universe. But to answer the question, it can be anti-climactic, like anything.",3095.6,3101.52,24,Robert
1072," I mean, this is surreal, you know? I've never...",3101.52,3104.6400000000003,16,Robert
1073," maybe seen you around a little bit, but I feel like I know you, because I see you all the time,",3104.6400000000003,3110.88,26,Robert
1074," and I listen to you, and I'm a martial arts nut. And...",3110.88,3116.1600000000003,18,Robert
1075," Yeah, isn't it? Sometimes when you get outside of the fortunate, interesting, creative experience",3116.64,3126.72,21,Robert
1076," you're having, you kind of go like, it's very dreamlike. Yeah. Yeah, my whole life's a dream.",3126.72,3132.64,29,Robert
1077," Yeah. There's that for the ramifications, the ramifications.",3132.64,3135.2,16,Robert
1078," That's for real. When those come back, a bite in the ass, you're like,",3135.2,3138.7999999999997,22,Robert
1079," yikes, this is a fucking dream at all. This is dangerous.",3138.7999999999997,3142.3199999999997,17,Robert
1080," Yeah, I used to... I remember the first time I met Phil Hartman, I was stunned that I was actually",3142.48,3149.2000000000003,26,Robert
1081," like sitting at... we were at a stable read, sitting across from, and I'm like, how the fuck...",3149.2000000000003,3154.0800000000004,26,Robert
1082," you're a famous guy. Like, you're a really famous guy. I've seen you in movies, man.",3154.0800000000004,3158.0,26,Robert
1083," Yeah. You've seen you on television. Here you are, right there. How weird.",3158.0,3162.2400000000002,21,Robert
1084," You know, and it seems... it's very hard to be normal. And then after a while, that becomes normal.",3162.2400000000002,3170.0800000000004,27,Robert
1085, And then the fact that it becomes normal becomes surreal. And then it really feels like a dream.,3170.08,3175.6,22,Robert
1086," Like, when I meet people like, we've just met an hour or so ago.",3175.6,3180.48,20,Robert
1087," Yet instantly, I feel like I know you. Yeah. Yeah, it's very strange.",3180.48,3183.6,21,Robert
1088," But also, you're not full of shit. You know, when someone's not full of shit, it's pretty easy",3184.16,3188.96,27,Robert
1089," to get to know them. You say something, I say something, back, go, I know how he works.",3188.96,3193.44,26,Robert
1090, I see what's going on in there. This is an actual human. Here we go. We're talking.,3193.44,3197.44,25,Robert
1091," There's a good litmus, too, because you watch your show pretty quickly. And I just love it, too,",3197.44,3202.16,27,Robert
1092," because in your show, you literally, you just... you start... it's a rolling start with you every time.",3202.16,3206.8,26,Robert
1093, You come into the show and you're already kind of thinking about stuff.,3206.8,3209.52,17,Robert
1094," So it feels very organic. And part of me, even this morning, was like, I hope he looks into my eyes",3210.2400000000002,3217.68,27,Robert
1095, and doesn't see a complete and utter foolish fron. Because I would probably believe him if he,3217.68,3224.16,22,Robert
1096," mere that back to me. Oh, no, that's a danger, right? Yeah. If you respect someone and they think",3224.16,3229.6,28,Robert
1097," you're a fucking idiot, you're like, oh no, I might really be a fucking idiot. But there's been times",3229.6,3234.64,28,Robert
1098," when in just being myself, someone who I respect, as looked at me and said, what are we talking about?",3234.64,3241.04,26,Robert
1099," Yeah. What do you even say? For sure. And you remember that, because it kind of... Yeah.",3241.04,3245.04,25,Robert
1100," It stiff arms you. But part of those are good, because it realized, well, you were probably off",3245.04,3248.8799999999997,24,Robert
1101," on a fucking stupid tangent. And that's part of being a person. You know, part of being a person is like,",3248.8799999999997,3253.6,28,Robert
1102, I don't know what the next word out of my mouth is going to be right now. No one ever does.,3254.16,3258.3199999999997,26,Robert
1103," Unless you do, and if you do, it's kind of weird. Some people are poker players. I respect some people",3258.3199999999997,3264.0,27,Robert
1104," that are that, because there's an ability to... Maybe it's fear-based. But I always appreciate people",3264.0,3276.72,25,Robert
1105," who... You know, those people like their icons or big shots or that they hold a certain steam",3276.72,3282.16,22,Robert
1106," and all of their texts are very simple. It's like, yes. Yes, we should fix that. Sure.",3282.16,3288.48,26,Robert
1107," Yeah, sure is my favorite. Sure. Okay, on it. Yeah. Yeah, no periods either. You don't have time",3289.52,3295.44,29,Robert
1108," to make a period. It beats the all caps, texts. Yeah, I don't like those all. Those people weird.",3295.44,3300.7999999999997,28,Robert
1109," Although CT Fletcher, he sends me all text. Okay. I love him. But he's shouting at everything.",3300.7999999999997,3306.24,27,Robert
1110," Everything is a shout. Yeah. But yeah, the surreal part is, I think part of the reason I'm still so",3306.24,3314.3199999999997,27,Robert
1111," interested, not just in life, but also, you know, getting to do what I do, is I'm a fan. I love",3314.3199999999997,3323.12,30,Robert
1112, movies. I love creativity. I love music. I love culture. And the fact that I actually have a place,3323.9199999999996,3331.3599999999997,25,Robert
1113," in it while I'm observing it and digging it is like, it's... it's... it's an honor.",3331.36,3339.04,26,Robert
1114," Well, that's a beautiful perspective. And that shows in how you... how you carry yourself and",3339.76,3346.0,22,Robert
1115," it shows in the work that you do, that you do appreciate it. You know, one of the saddest things",3346.0,3350.08,26,Robert
1116, is someone who's in an amazing position who doesn't appreciate it. And that drives other people,3350.08,3356.8,21,Robert
1117," crazy too. Like, Premadana's drive people crazy for a variety of reasons. But one of the big",3356.8,3361.84,25,Robert
1118," ones is you don't appreciate how fortunate you are. Like, and people love when people appreciate",3361.84,3369.1200000000003,21,Robert
1119," good fortune and appreciate a well-earned position and are, you know, engrossed in a beautiful life",3369.1200000000003,3377.44,27,Robert
1120, of something that they really enjoy and something that really inspires them.,3377.44,3381.6000000000004,15,Robert
1121," Well, I need to be kept right-sized because I can easily fall into self-seeking and depression",3381.92,3390.96,24,Robert
1122," and self-pity and judgment and all that stuff. It's kind of a... it's a bit of a default,",3390.96,3397.12,28,Robert
1123," but I spend enough energy and I've had enough help over enough years to actually just say,",3397.12,3404.4,21,Robert
1124," oh, that's just awful, destructive behavior. You're entertaining in your head, you know.",3404.4,3412.1600000000003,22,Robert
1125," Bad patterns, just bad thought patterns. Yeah. Yeah. I think we could all fall into those. I'm",3412.1600000000003,3417.44,25,Robert
1126," ruthlessly self-critical. For me, sometimes it's very hard to step outside and just take a pause",3417.44,3424.2400000000002,25,Robert
1127, and recognize that not everything's going to be right the first time you try it. I think that,3424.2400000000002,3429.92,22,Robert
1128," a lot of people that are really graded things, it's one of the things about them is that they're",3430.64,3435.6800000000003,25,Robert
1129," not very satisfied with their work. Like, they're always looking to improve it. They're always looking",3435.6800000000003,3440.48,23,Robert
1130, for it to be better and then that can start that cycle in their head of self-loathing and anxiety,3440.48,3447.12,25,Robert
1131, and anger at their performance or their work or whatever it is. And then that can lead to depression,3447.12,3452.8,22,Robert
1132," and that can lead to just self-hate. Yeah. And what are your tolerances? Like,",3452.8,3457.44,24,Robert
1133," I'll be the first to tell you, like, you know, do certain movies or movie doing",3458.16,3462.48,22,Robert
1134," Tropic Thunder or one of the first Iron Man movies I was like, I'll go over to the monitor,",3462.48,3466.4,25,Robert
1135," I'd be like, play that back again. That was so good. Do let me see that again. I need confirmation.",3466.4,3472.48,28,Robert
1136, Yeah. Because it's always a miracle. You stayed in frame. You got the line right. Your eye line,3472.48,3478.4,25,Robert
1137," was right. The lighting was right. The sensibility was right. And you just look at it and you go, oh,",3478.4,3484.64,28,Robert
1138," you know, it's like, I don't know. For me, it's like the playback of the perfect Superman punch",3485.6,3489.8399999999997,27,Robert
1139," KO and just go show me that again. Yeah. Or when we were shooting Tropic Thunder, I had a little",3489.8399999999997,3496.64,26,Robert
1140," teaser clip for Iron Man, but it wasn't coming out until the next year and we were going to go to",3498.16,3503.3599999999997,25,Robert

1142," that movie's going to do pretty good. And then when we went to Comic Con, we saw it. But",3509.12,3513.2799999999997,25,Robert
1143," it used to be like that with music too. Like I write music. I haven't for some time, but you would",3513.44,3519.0400000000004,27,Robert
1144," write something and then you just listen to it on the loop because you go, wow, that's not.",3519.0400000000004,3523.0400000000004,24,Robert
1145," I know that I was here and I did that, but it feels kind of inspired. Yeah. And you want to",3523.0400000000004,3528.48,26,Robert
1146," get all that stuff. But yeah, self-critical is important as long as it doesn't bleed out into",3528.48,3535.0400000000004,25,Robert
1147," and over the edges and just make everyone archer miserable. Right. Again, get out of your own way.",3535.0400000000004,3540.96,25,Robert
1148," Again, I mean, that's one of the many tenants of life. Learn how to get out of your own way",3541.36,3546.48,26,Robert
1149," with everything, including with creative endeavors. It seems like that thing that you said about",3546.48,3551.04,19,Robert
1150," music, most people who write things or create things say that. They know they're doing it. Like,",3551.04,3558.48,24,Robert
1151," if you make a great sculpture, you know you're doing it. But where is it coming from? Like, what is",3558.48,3563.04,27,Robert
1152, what is the idea that manifests itself into this perfect thing that you can step back and look at?,3563.04,3568.7200000000003,22,Robert
1153," And it seems surreal that how did I create that? Did I? I don't know if I did. I mean, I definitely",3568.72,3573.4399999999996,29,Robert
1154," made my fingers move, but I don't know if that's me. Who wrote that music? Who performed it? I know",3573.4399999999996,3579.2799999999997,28,Robert
1155," you did, but there's a thing inside you that sort of like tunes in to this this energy of ideas.",3579.9199999999996,3587.8399999999997,25,Robert
1156," And then it comes through you. And again, you kind of have to get out of your own way while you're",3587.8399999999997,3592.3199999999997,26,Robert
1157," writing something. And then when it comes out, it's a weird feeling. It's not like, like, if you",3592.3199999999997,3598.0,27,Robert
1158," hammer a nail into a board, you fucking are very aware you did that. You're very aware. But there's",3598.0,3603.44,26,Robert
1159, something about the creative process that's not you're not totally there. It's weird.,3603.44,3609.2,20,Robert
1160," Yeah, because it is you and it isn't. Yeah. Right. And it was you. Even me. And I love it.",3610.88,3618.16,30,Robert
1161," You always hear it too. And sports, it's like, you know, oh, you know, uh, you know,",3618.16,3623.36,28,Robert

1165, something and they don't even have any idea they're going to do it and they did it. And then it,3640.6400000000003,3644.4,25,Robert
1166, caused the knockout. It's their training manifest itself in this one special beautiful moment.,3644.4,3649.6800000000003,20,Robert
1167," We're bang. This thing happens. And then they see the guy drop and like, holy shit. Oh, yeah.",3649.68,3654.48,27,Robert
1168, And then they walk away. And it's the work. It's it's there's so many things involved. Right.,3654.48,3660.7999999999997,27,Robert
1169, There's so many moving pieces. You have to be working on your own mind to learn how to get out of,3660.7999999999997,3664.64,25,Robert
1170, your own way. You also have to be like really engrossed in whatever the activity is that you're,3664.64,3669.3599999999997,25,Robert
1171," doing, like obsessed in love with it, passionate about it. And then you have to have the discipline",3669.3599999999997,3674.48,23,Robert
1172, to show up and actually do the work. There's so many different moving peat and it all has to be,3674.48,3678.8799999999997,25,Robert

1185," Traditional Wing Chun. Really? Yeah. Which is very underrated art form. Yes. Also,",3756.96,3764.48,22,Robert

1193, One of the best fighters in the UFC uses it regularly. Tony Ferguson.,3811.12,3816.7999999999997,17,Robert
1194, Tony Ferguson uses trapping hands. The Muk-Jong. Yeah. Yeah. He grabs wrists and comes over,3816.7999999999997,3823.2799999999997,25,Robert
1195, the top of the elbows. He does straight Wing Chun. He does it all the time. And he even practices on a,3823.2799999999997,3827.44,27,Robert
1196, wooden dummy. Yeah. I got my ass kicked by a wooden dummy for about three years and then I finally,3827.44,3835.8399999999997,24,Robert
1197," understood the principle of don't fight force and force. And you know, it's just nuts. So,",3836.7200000000003,3844.7200000000003,24,Robert
1198," anyway, half the time, if I would be in a critical artistic situation, I would just say,",3844.7200000000003,3853.84,23,Robert

1200, go back to how did this kind of relate to because I don't like getting clocked and getting my teeth,3859.6,3865.7599999999998,24,Robert

1202, well. You wear a mouthpiece? It's certainly not because he's very good at pulling his punches. And,3871.92,3876.7999999999997,25,Robert
1203, he's also even better at making sure that I don't accidentally hit him. But we get as close as we can,3876.7999999999997,3883.04,26,Robert
1204," to what the real experience would be. But again, it's like everything. I'm sure",3883.04,3889.7599999999998,21,Robert
1205," you know, a few clicks back down the road, there's things that instructors were doing that would",3891.7599999999998,3895.92,22,Robert

1208, Yes. His students would get beat up. Yes. It was a normal thing. Yes.,3908.08,3912.08,21,Robert
1209," So, did you start training for Sherlock Holmes or did you start training before that?",3914.08,3918.7999999999997,19,Robert
1210, I didn't. It absolutely coincided with my recovery. And the two things just somehow or,3918.7999999999997,3926.16,21,Robert
1211, or others seemed to lock in when and talked to you off the record and afterwards about any,3926.16,3935.68,20,Robert
1212, and everything to do with my recovery as far as it locked him with this. It was an apprentice,3935.68,3941.04,22,Robert
1213, and apprenticeship. And it was an apprenticeship that was contingent on me being in a certain,3941.04,3946.7999999999997,20,Robert
1214," headspace. Well, it's a good thing too because it's a very addictive thing. People get very",3947.44,3954.72,24,Robert
1215," addicted to martial arts and it's a good substitute for sometimes negative addictions. You know,",3954.72,3960.3999999999996,21,Robert
1216," Bourdain before he died. He was obsessed with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Yeah, became really obsessed with",3960.3999999999996,3966.3199999999997,26,Robert
1217, it at 58 and got really good. He was training every day and he was training twice a day every day.,3966.3199999999997,3973.6,25,Robert
1218," So, he went from when I first met him, he was chubby, he was smoking cigarettes, he drank every",3973.6,3978.16,26,Robert
1219," night, still kind of still drank every night. But, you know, he just did enough to, he didn't",3978.16,3982.7999999999997,26,Robert
1220, enough healthy things to keep his body together. And then his ex-wife got really into Jiu-Jitsu.,3982.8,3989.84,26,Robert
1221, And then he decided to follow one day to classes and he was kind of mocking it and laughing at it,3989.84,3995.1200000000003,23,Robert
1222," first and then became obsessed. And then really got good. I mean, he was and at the, look at",3995.1200000000003,4000.48,25,Robert
1223," he wanted a tournament. I mean, oh my gosh. Yeah, he's fucking 60 years old. Yeah, he's a",4000.48,4004.8,28,Robert
1224," age. What's really crazy is a picture of him walking down the street in, I think they were in",4004.8,4009.28,24,Robert
1225," Rome and he has no shirt on and he's fucking ripped. Anthony Bourdain, full six pack. Yeah,",4009.28,4015.84,26,Robert

1227," That's crazy. He's like 60 something years old there. So, he would take a private lesson every day",4020.7200000000003,4026.88,25,Robert
1228," and then he would take a class. So, he would take a private lesson, sharpen up techniques and then",4026.88,4031.0400000000004,24,Robert
1229," he would roll, take group classes too, which is very critical. We got to roll with different people.",4031.0400000000004,4036.2400000000002,24,Robert
1230," 100%. Yeah. And so, he was in there. And it became a good thing for him to sort of become addicted",4036.3199999999997,4042.3999999999996,27,Robert
1231," to this positive thing. Yeah, I mean, for me, it wasn't going to be golf. It wasn't going to be",4042.3999999999996,4048.4799999999996,29,Robert
1232," something passive like that. Right. You know, I hear it's great, but it's been, it's just been a great",4048.4799999999996,4055.04,29,Robert
1233," gift. And it's also the thing where, you know, you're just, you're never done. I made black belt",4055.04,4058.9599999999996,28,Robert
1234," five years ago for another grading and now we're doing a lot of weapon stuff and it's just, I",4058.9599999999996,4065.12,24,Robert
1235, just think that's awesome. Congratulations. Yeah. My Taigwondo teacher said something to me when I was,4065.12,4070.24,25,Robert
1236, very young. He said that it is a tool for developing your human potential. Yeah. And I never,4070.24,4076.7999999999997,23,Robert
1237," forgot that because I'm like, yeah, it's because it's really difficult to do. Like all martial arts",4076.7999999999997,4080.72,25,Robert
1238," are really, it's really difficult to get your body to move that way and to be able to be effective",4080.72,4084.96,24,Robert
1239, in a conflict situation. And if you can do it and you can do it over and over again and you can,4084.96,4088.96,25,Robert
1240, overcome that difficult thing and you thought it was unsurmountable and then you figured out how to,4088.96,4093.2799999999997,22,Robert

1254, doesn't work. Yeah. And I love how messy it was at the beginning too because the style matchups,4170.72,4175.360000000001,24,Robert
1255, were so if they were almost crazy laughable until you until you saw the violence and no weight classes.,4175.360000000001,4181.360000000001,23,Robert
