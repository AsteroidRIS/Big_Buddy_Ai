19, How do you know what he felt?,29.0,31.0,10,Neil_WHO
20, Because this is not a representation of reality.,31.0,34.0,11,Neil_WHO
21, Oh.,34.0,35.0,4,Neil_WHO
22, And anything that deviates from reality is reality that has filtered through your senses.,35.0,41.0,18,Neil_WHO

81, and that enables us to trace over what's set of weeks this painting was actually painted.,196.0,203.0,20,Neil_WHO

238, And it was one of the greatest collaborative efforts we've ever undertaken in my field of astrophysics.,664.0,669.0,23,Neil_WHO
239, Okay.,669.0,670.0,4,Neil_WHO
240, And everybody was loving the results.,670.0,671.0,9,Neil_WHO
241," So all I tweeted was,",671.0,673.0,8,Neil_WHO

245, Ah.,679.0,680.0,4,Neil_WHO
246, Scientist report humans are warming the earth.,680.0,684.0,11,Neil_WHO
247," Oh, you brought it up.",684.0,686.0,9,Neil_WHO

249, Scientist.,687.0,688.0,5,Neil_WHO
250, We produce the first ever image of a supermassive black hole 55 million light years away.,688.0,692.0,21,Neil_WHO
251, The response.,692.0,693.0,5,Neil_WHO
252, Ooh.,693.0,694.0,4,Neil_WHO
253, Scientist.,694.0,695.0,5,Neil_WHO
254, We've concluded that humans are catastrophically warming the earth.,695.0,698.0,14,Neil_WHO
255, Response.,698.0,699.0,4,Neil_WHO
256, That conflicts with what I want to be true so it must be false.,699.0,702.0,17,Neil_WHO
257," Well, that is the cherry picking of science.",702.0,704.0,12,Neil_WHO
258, It is the cherry picking of science.,704.0,705.0,10,Neil_WHO
259, But the global warming thing is very much connected to a certain type of ideology.,705.0,711.0,18,Neil_WHO

265," What I'm, what I'm trying to say is that is a demographic that has cherry picked science",717.0,724.0,22,Neil_WHO
266, to deny human cause global warming.,724.0,726.0,9,Neil_WHO
267, There are other demographics that have cherry picked other science to deny other things.,727.0,732.0,17,Neil_WHO
268, And it's not all located in one political spectrum.,732.0,737.0,13,Neil_WHO
269," I mean, one political branch.",737.0,739.0,9,Neil_WHO
270, Right.,739.0,740.0,4,Neil_WHO
271, So you tend to find liberal folk complaining that the conservatives who have embraced,740.0,745.0,16,Neil_WHO
272, know the global warming platform are denying science and they need science on their side.,745.0,750.0,18,Neil_WHO
273, And many of those same people are rubbing crystals together to be healed by the crystal energy.,750.0,755.0,20,Neil_WHO
274," Or they're denying vaccines, thinking that there's somehow bad for you.",755.0,760.0,17,Neil_WHO
275," And so, so all of this requires some or total rejection of mainstream science.",760.0,768.0,18,Neil_WHO

280, Like how many people are really in denial of science in 2019?,785.0,789.0,15,Neil_WHO
281, It's got to be for me.,789.0,790.0,10,Neil_WHO
282," For me, in a free country, that's no one matters.",790.0,792.0,16,Neil_WHO
283, What matters is in a free country that you elect officials who are not.,792.0,795.0,17,Neil_WHO
284, Officials.,795.0,796.0,5,Neil_WHO
285," Yes, you elect people who are scientifically literate.",796.0,799.0,13,Neil_WHO
286, Yeah.,799.0,800.0,4,Neil_WHO
287, They don't have to be scientists.,800.0,801.0,10,Neil_WHO
288," And if they're not scientifically literate, they should be self-aware of that.",801.0,807.0,20,Neil_WHO
289, And then listen to people who are.,807.0,810.0,10,Neil_WHO
290, Right.,810.0,811.0,4,Neil_WHO
291," So, don't you think what they're doing though is they're doing what their constituents would like them to do?",811.0,818.0,26,Neil_WHO
292, That's why I don't beat politicians over the head.,818.0,821.0,14,Neil_WHO
293, Ever.,821.0,822.0,4,Neil_WHO
294, I don't do that.,822.0,823.0,8,Neil_WHO

296," Whatever they believe, if they think Earth is 6,000 years old, and they got elected, it's because the people elected them believe they're Earth is 6,000 years old.",826.0,834.0,40,Neil_WHO
297, Or because they're willing to let that one go because they believe in the policies.,834.0,837.0,19,Neil_WHO
298," Oh, possibly.",837.0,838.0,6,Neil_WHO
299, That's a good point because you have a portfolio of thoughts and beliefs.,838.0,841.0,17,Neil_WHO
300, Or because you're such a profound Christian.,841.0,843.0,11,Neil_WHO
301," I mean, he's so profoundly Christian that he just wants to live in a literal position.",843.0,847.0,21,Neil_WHO
302," There are plenty of Christians who are connected to science that don't, including the Pope.",847.0,851.0,20,Neil_WHO

304," Yeah, he believes in science now.",854.0,856.0,10,Neil_WHO
305, This new Pope is pretty interesting.,856.0,857.0,9,Neil_WHO
306," Yeah, if you read his encyclical from a couple of years ago, it's a scientifically literate.",857.0,863.0,25,Neil_WHO
307, It's a literate document.,863.0,865.0,9,Neil_WHO
308, Yeah.,865.0,866.0,4,Neil_WHO
309," And no, there's, okay, so it's not, he's still religious, right?",866.0,869.0,22,Neil_WHO
310," So Jesus still rose from the dead, and there was still miracles and all the rest of that in the New Testament.",869.0,874.0,26,Neil_WHO
311, So he's not in denial of that.,874.0,876.0,11,Neil_WHO
312," But given that, he is saying, oh my gosh, here's something, we, the religious community, and scientists can partner behind, and that is we want to save life on Earth.",876.0,886.0,41,Neil_WHO
313, And so we have to be better shepherds of what is going on on this Earth.,886.0,890.0,21,Neil_WHO
314," And one of them is we don't want to flood low-lying countries in the South Pacific, where the average sea level is 10 feet above sea level, or whatever it is.",890.0,899.0,39,Neil_WHO
315," You're going to lose these countries if you keep melting our, our, our, um, the ice caps, because that would include a North, and there's no land in the North.",899.0,909.0,41,Neil_WHO
316," So the glacier ice, that's land-based ice, right?",909.0,912.0,16,Neil_WHO
317," Because any ice that's in the water floating, that can melt and it's not going to change the water level.",912.0,918.0,26,Neil_WHO
318," So it's why you can do this experiment. It's really cool. Fill up your glass, put some, a few cubes of ice in a glass of water, fill the glass up as much as you possibly can without spilling it.",918.0,928.0,51,Neil_WHO
319, And the ice is bobbing above that level.,928.0,931.0,12,Neil_WHO
320," Okay, because ice is about 10% buoyant on that. About 10% of an ice cube will be lifted above. This, this is the, this is the iceberg equation, right?",931.0,939.0,41,Neil_WHO
321," That's the tip of the iceberg. Well, you see the 10% above and 90% is not visible to you.",939.0,945.0,27,Neil_WHO
322," This is, by the way, I don't want to get too many off-ramps here, but that's one of the things that they did right in Titanic.",945.0,951.0,37,Neil_WHO
323," Okay, if you look at the earliest Titanic movie, there was in black and white. They see this huge iceberg on the horizon, and then it can't swear away from it, because it, oh my gosh, it doesn't have to know.",951.0,963.0,53,Neil_WHO
324," No, no. The iceberg that cuts the bottom of your boat is a little bit of ice sticking out above the water, because 90% of it is underwater.",963.0,971.0,35,Neil_WHO
325," And that's where the damage occurs. And in the James Cameron Titanic, the iceberg that they hit above water was looks like a little chunk of ice.",971.0,980.0,33,Neil_WHO
326," Oh, that couldn't hurt anything. All the damage was under word. Anyhow, so back to this. So do this experiment, and then let the glass sit there and let the ice melt.",980.0,989.0,43,Neil_WHO
327," And the water levels stay the same, because when ice melts, it takes a lower volume than it was when it became ice.",989.0,997.0,28,Neil_WHO
328, And that's why pipes break.,997.0,1000.0,9,Neil_WHO
329, I thought pipes break just because the water expands.,1000.0,1004.0,12,Neil_WHO
330," Yeah, I just described that in the opposite direction.",1004.0,1006.0,13,Neil_WHO
331," Oh, right.",1006.0,1007.0,6,Neil_WHO
332," Oh, so because as it freezes it, but it didn't know it gets larger.",1007.0,1010.0,21,Neil_WHO
333," That's what expansion means. What kind of, what's with your vocabulary here?",1010.0,1014.0,19,Neil_WHO
334," No, but I'm saying like, no, no, right. So your ice cube is sitting 10% larger.",1014.0,1018.0,26,Neil_WHO
335," Your ice cube is sitting 10% above the water level, and it melts and becomes water.",1018.0,1022.0,21,Neil_WHO
336, The water takes up 90% of the volume of the ice.,1022.0,1026.0,15,Neil_WHO
337," So that just melts back into the water, and it doesn't overflow, even though it was sticking above the water line when you had the glass.",1026.0,1033.0,32,Neil_WHO
338, So now let's do the opposite.,1033.0,1035.0,10,Neil_WHO
339, There's water in the pipes.,1035.0,1037.0,9,Neil_WHO
340, Can I tell you something that might blow your mind?,1037.0,1039.0,13,Neil_WHO
341, No.,1039.0,1040.0,4,Neil_WHO
342, Sure.,1040.0,1041.0,4,Neil_WHO
343," Is that allowed? How many times does your mind, at least once a day?",1041.0,1045.0,19,Neil_WHO
344," Yeah, at least one.",1045.0,1046.0,8,Neil_WHO
345, You need your mind blown.,1046.0,1047.0,8,Neil_WHO
346, Okay. Here's how it works.,1047.0,1048.0,10,Neil_WHO
347, Okay.,1048.0,1049.0,4,Neil_WHO
348, So let's put water in the pipes.,1049.0,1052.0,11,Neil_WHO
349, Okay.,1052.0,1053.0,4,Neil_WHO
350, And then the temperature drops.,1053.0,1055.0,8,Neil_WHO
351, Now pipes have a certain strength.,1055.0,1057.0,9,Neil_WHO
352, Right.,1057.0,1058.0,4,Neil_WHO
353," Copper pipes, you know, they're rigid.",1058.0,1060.0,12,Neil_WHO
354, Okay.,1060.0,1061.0,4,Neil_WHO
355, Now we'll have them around breaking pipes.,1061.0,1062.0,11,Neil_WHO
356, Okay. So now watch.,1062.0,1063.0,8,Neil_WHO
357, We have to choose.,1063.0,1064.0,7,Neil_WHO
358," So the water is in there, and now the temperature begins to drop.",1064.0,1067.0,17,Neil_WHO
359, Okay.,1067.0,1068.0,4,Neil_WHO
360," Um, the water wants to turn to ice, but it can't because the pipe is containing it.",1069.0,1080.0,23,Neil_WHO
361, So it just sits there.,1080.0,1082.0,8,Neil_WHO
362, Okay.,1082.0,1083.0,4,Neil_WHO
363," At 32 degrees as water, even though the temperature outside is dropping below 32 degrees.",1083.0,1089.0,19,Neil_WHO
364, Okay.,1089.0,1090.0,4,Neil_WHO
365, And it still sits there.,1090.0,1092.0,8,Neil_WHO
366," I guess the 30 degrees, 29, the pipe is squeezing the attempt of this water to become ice.",1092.0,1100.0,23,Neil_WHO
367, And the act of squeezing it prevents the temperature from dropping.,1100.0,1104.0,14,Neil_WHO
368, Okay.,1104.0,1105.0,4,Neil_WHO
369," And you, the temperature drops depending on how strong the pipe is, and the temperature gradient across it,",1105.0,1111.0,23,Neil_WHO
370," as the outside temperature continues, it gets to now 25 degrees.",1111.0,1115.0,15,Neil_WHO
371, The pipe is still holding on to the liquid water.,1115.0,1117.0,13,Neil_WHO
372, And it's still 32 degrees inside there.,1117.0,1120.0,11,Neil_WHO
373," And it holds on to, and it's keeps happening.",1120.0,1122.0,14,Neil_WHO
374, It keeps happening.,1122.0,1123.0,6,Neil_WHO
375, You get a point where the pipe can no longer contain the water.,1123.0,1128.0,16,Neil_WHO
376, And the water freezes spontaneously.,1128.0,1133.0,9,Neil_WHO
377," It just goes right down to that temperature, and the pipe is helpless in the face of this.",1133.0,1139.0,22,Neil_WHO
378," So the point is the stronger the pipe is, the lower the temperature has to be outside for the freezing water to break it.",1139.0,1146.0,28,Neil_WHO
379," So theoretically, if you had a pipe that was made of a stronger material than copper, you can get even lower than that.",1146.0,1151.0,28,Neil_WHO
380, You get even lower temperatures.,1151.0,1152.0,8,Neil_WHO
381, How low can you get?,1152.0,1153.0,8,Neil_WHO
382," Because when things freeze, they have to expand?",1153.0,1157.0,12,Neil_WHO
383, So watch.,1157.0,1158.0,5,Neil_WHO
384, Not only when water freezes.,1158.0,1160.0,9,Neil_WHO
385, Why does water expand when it's a remarkable fact about water that is shared by very few other ingredients.,1160.0,1166.0,23,Neil_WHO
386," Most things when they cool, they shrink as all men know.",1166.0,1170.0,15,Neil_WHO
387," Oh, man.",1170.0,1171.0,6,Neil_WHO
388," So most materials, because things cooler, they're vibrating molecules slow down, and they take up less space.",1172.0,1182.0,24,Neil_WHO
389, Water is the opposite of that as it passes down through.,1182.0,1186.0,14,Neil_WHO
390, So I'm going to describe to you an extraordinary fact about water and why we're alive today.,1186.0,1191.0,22,Neil_WHO
391, So watch.,1191.0,1192.0,5,Neil_WHO
392, Let's take a lake that has fish in it.,1192.0,1194.0,13,Neil_WHO
393, Temperature drops outside.,1194.0,1197.0,7,Neil_WHO
394," And the lake slowly begins to get cooler, because there's a time lag between the air temperature and the waters.",1197.0,1203.0,25,Neil_WHO
395," That's why the first freeze, the lake is still there.",1203.0,1206.0,15,Neil_WHO
396, It's got to be cold longer.,1206.0,1207.0,10,Neil_WHO
397, So what happens?,1207.0,1208.0,6,Neil_WHO
398, The water gets cold on the surface.,1208.0,1210.0,10,Neil_WHO
399, Okay?,1210.0,1211.0,4,Neil_WHO
400, And it begins to...,1211.0,1218.0,7,Neil_WHO
401," Okay, the water gets cold on the surface and it begins to shrink.",1218.0,1221.0,17,Neil_WHO
402, So that water is shrink.,1221.0,1223.0,8,Neil_WHO
403, That makes a denser it falls to the bottom.,1223.0,1225.0,13,Neil_WHO
404, Fine.,1225.0,1226.0,4,Neil_WHO
405, It does that down to about four degrees Celsius.,1226.0,1229.0,12,Neil_WHO
406," As it goes from four degrees Celsius to zero degrees Celsius, the freezing point, it begins to expand and become less dense than the water.",1229.0,1239.0,30,Neil_WHO
407," So now, as the water wants to actually freeze, it stays on top.",1239.0,1245.0,18,Neil_WHO
408," When it does freeze, you freeze the top surface of the lake.",1245.0,1249.0,16,Neil_WHO
409," Well, how about the water below it?",1249.0,1251.0,11,Neil_WHO
410, It's insulated from the dropping air temperature and the fish don't die.,1251.0,1255.0,18,Neil_WHO
411, Imagine if ice were denser than water.,1255.0,1258.0,11,Neil_WHO
412," What would happen? You'd freeze the top layer, it would sink.",1258.0,1261.0,17,Neil_WHO
413, The bottom is frozen.,1261.0,1262.0,7,Neil_WHO
414, Freeze the next layer.,1262.0,1263.0,7,Neil_WHO
415, It sinks and fish would be systematically forced to swim in shallower and shallower waters until they were all,1263.0,1271.0,23,Neil_WHO
416, freeze dried on the top surface of the lake.,1271.0,1274.0,12,Neil_WHO
417, And all fishes would be dead every winter in every lake.,1274.0,1280.0,14,Neil_WHO
418, I think it's fish.,1280.0,1281.0,8,Neil_WHO
419, What?,1281.0,1282.0,4,Neil_WHO
420, I think you're supposed to say fishes.,1282.0,1283.0,11,Neil_WHO
421, Fishes is a double plural.,1283.0,1285.0,9,Neil_WHO
422, You could do that?,1285.0,1286.0,7,Neil_WHO
423, You never heard fish would be dead?,1286.0,1288.0,10,Neil_WHO
424, You never heard.,1288.0,1289.0,6,Neil_WHO
425, Would you say all deers?,1289.0,1290.0,9,Neil_WHO
426," Well, because generally, if you had multiple kinds of deer, so if you had, like, sit, kiddie, and white.",1290.0,1296.0,30,Neil_WHO
427, But it's rare that they're all in the same place.,1296.0,1298.0,15,Neil_WHO
428," Generally, one kind of deer won't play.",1298.0,1299.0,12,Neil_WHO
429, But the ocean has many kind of fish in the same place.,1299.0,1302.0,15,Neil_WHO
430, That's interesting.,1302.0,1303.0,6,Neil_WHO
431, So you would say fishes.,1303.0,1304.0,8,Neil_WHO
432, Fishes is a double plural.,1304.0,1306.0,9,Neil_WHO
433, It's different kinds of plural fish.,1306.0,1308.0,10,Neil_WHO
434," Oh, yeah.",1308.0,1309.0,6,Neil_WHO
435, Double below my mind.,1309.0,1310.0,7,Neil_WHO

437," Oh, no, no, no.",1312.0,1313.0,10,Neil_WHO
438, I didn't know.,1313.0,1314.0,7,Neil_WHO
439, I never thought about that way.,1314.0,1315.0,9,Neil_WHO
440," The many fishes in the, oh, yeah.",1315.0,1316.0,12,Neil_WHO
441, Yeah.,1316.0,1317.0,4,Neil_WHO
442," Yeah, so sorry.",1317.0,1318.0,7,Neil_WHO
443, Fishes in the sea.,1318.0,1319.0,8,Neil_WHO
444, Yeah.,1319.0,1320.0,4,Neil_WHO
445," So, multiple plurals of different kinds of fish.",1320.0,1321.0,14,Neil_WHO
446, How close we have to get where ocean water freezes?,1321.0,1323.0,14,Neil_WHO
447, Because that's where it starts.,1323.0,1324.0,9,Neil_WHO

1726, The point is to transmit information.,5135.72,5138.72,9,Neil_WHO

1730, everything is running on energy because they're thinking energy is going to be free in the future.,5150.72,5156.72,21,Neil_WHO
1731, But what they didn't figure was that information would be free,5156.72,5161.72,14,Neil_WHO
1732, or easy to transmit and to generate and to store and to delete.,5161.72,5168.72,16,Neil_WHO
1733," And whereas the energy that would take to move things and to drive things,",5168.72,5173.72,17,Neil_WHO

1837, No light can bounce off of it.,5400.72,5401.72,10,Neil_WHO

1848, That's not what I saw.,5416.72,5417.72,9,Neil_WHO
1849, I saw a sports car version.,5417.72,5419.72,9,Neil_WHO
1850, I saw Vanta Black car.,5419.72,5420.72,9,Neil_WHO
1851, They have them.,5420.72,5421.72,6,Neil_WHO

1857, That's the BMW that they painted Vanta Black.,5426.72,5427.72,13,Neil_WHO

1871, Maybe it wasn't a BMW.,5448.72,5449.72,9,Neil_WHO
1872, Maybe somebody else did.,5449.72,5450.72,7,Neil_WHO
1873, No.,5450.72,5451.72,4,Neil_WHO
1874," I'm just saying BMW, if someone did it, BMW didn't make it themselves.",5451.72,5455.72,20,Neil_WHO
1875, Okay.,5455.72,5456.72,4,Neil_WHO
1876, Someone must have done it.,5456.72,5457.72,8,Neil_WHO
1877," I mean, you can do it.",5457.72,5458.72,10,Neil_WHO
1878, It's a real thing.,5458.72,5459.72,8,Neil_WHO
1879, Vanta Black is a real car.,5459.72,5460.72,10,Neil_WHO
1880," So one of the principles of stealth is that if you send a signal to it,",5460.72,5465.72,19,Neil_WHO
1881, it never comes back to you.,5465.72,5467.72,9,Neil_WHO
1882, So you have no sort of radar measure of its existence.,5467.72,5470.72,14,Neil_WHO
1883, I saw it pop.,5470.72,5471.72,7,Neil_WHO
1884, Correct.,5471.72,5473.72,4,Neil_WHO
1885, But there are two ways you can do that.,5473.72,5475.72,12,Neil_WHO
1886, One of them is you cannot reflect back.,5475.72,5478.72,11,Neil_WHO
1887, Okay.,5478.72,5479.72,4,Neil_WHO
1888, But by absorbing it.,5479.72,5480.72,7,Neil_WHO
1889, Right.,5480.72,5481.72,4,Neil_WHO
1890, Okay.,5481.72,5482.72,4,Neil_WHO
1891, So a jet matte black will absorb it and not reflect it back.,5482.72,5486.72,16,Neil_WHO
1892," But if there's enough energy coming at it, it will heat up.",5486.72,5490.72,17,Neil_WHO
1893, You can't get something for nothing here.,5490.72,5492.72,11,Neil_WHO
1894, It will heat up the skin of that and it could be bad for the occupants.,5492.72,5496.72,20,Neil_WHO
1895, That's what they said about the article about Vanta Black.,5496.72,5499.72,15,Neil_WHO
1896, Yeah.,5499.72,5500.72,4,Neil_WHO
1897," If you put that in the desert, forget it.",5500.72,5501.72,13,Neil_WHO

1899, They were so hot.,5502.72,5503.72,7,Neil_WHO
1900, Exactly.,5503.72,5504.72,4,Neil_WHO
1901, So another way to do it is the signal comes to me and I reflect it in a direction that is not back to you.,5504.72,5511.72,28,Neil_WHO
1902, So the B2 bomber is not only non-reflective back to you.,5511.72,5517.72,19,Neil_WHO
1903, It takes the signal and reflects it and double bounces it so that all your energy gets sent in other directions and not back to you.,5517.72,5526.72,29,Neil_WHO
1904, So it doesn't then keep the energy that was sent to it.,5526.72,5530.72,16,Neil_WHO
1905, So that's another way to do it.,5530.72,5532.72,11,Neil_WHO
1906," There's another stuff which was featured in one of the recent, not recent four years ago, James Bond movies, where light that comes at it, the light that's behind it, goes around it coherently and comes back to you.",5532.72,5546.72,50,Neil_WHO
1907, And it's not there.,5546.72,5547.72,8,Neil_WHO
1908, You are seeing what's behind it.,5547.72,5548.72,10,Neil_WHO
1909, But the path of that light went around the vessel and continued on its way to you.,5548.72,5553.72,20,Neil_WHO
1910," So you think you're just seeing the grass in the tree, but there's a car sitting right there.",5553.72,5566.72,24,Neil_WHO

1913, Right now it exists only for a look up a stealth light ray stealth.,5571.72,5578.72,17,Neil_WHO
1914, And so the material has to be able to know what is behind it.,5578.72,5583.72,17,Neil_WHO
1915, Do you think small objects only?,5583.72,5585.72,9,Neil_WHO

2292, We're here alive today because of regulation.,6577.72,6579.72,11,Neil_WHO

2302, That was like the baseline number.,6618.72,6620.72,9,Neil_WHO
2303, That number is near zero now.,6620.72,6624.72,9,Neil_WHO

2320, You can't find anything.,6677.72,6679.72,8,Neil_WHO
2321," Oh, okay.",6679.72,6682.72,6,Neil_WHO
2322, But laboratory stealth light.,6682.72,6690.72,7,Neil_WHO
2323, Something.,6690.72,6691.72,4,Neil_WHO
2324, Try that.,6691.72,6692.72,5,Neil_WHO
2325, I found the clokes that people wear that sort of seems like video.,6692.72,6696.72,17,Neil_WHO
2326," Yeah, yeah, that seems like fuckery.",6696.72,6699.72,12,Neil_WHO
2327," Yeah, there's a lot of what.",6699.72,6700.72,11,Neil_WHO
2328," But in Harry Potter, the clokes that they wear, the invisibility cloak, that would be this principal.",6700.72,6707.72,25,Neil_WHO
2329, Yeah.,6707.72,6708.72,4,Neil_WHO
2330, If it existed with that.,6708.72,6710.72,8,Neil_WHO
2331," There's a bunch of videos of that, but it seems like they're just using after effects like Adobe or something like that to.",6710.72,6717.72,29,Neil_WHO
2332, To have fuck with the video rather than create an actual product that because there was a woman in an office that had a blanket.,6717.72,6723.72,28,Neil_WHO
2333, And she held up the blanket and you could only see the whole office.,6723.72,6727.72,17,Neil_WHO
2334, You wouldn't see the blanket at all.,6727.72,6729.72,11,Neil_WHO
2335, You'd see what's behind her.,6729.72,6730.72,10,Neil_WHO
2336, Behind her.,6730.72,6731.72,5,Neil_WHO
2337, And she lowered the blanket.,6731.72,6732.72,8,Neil_WHO
2338, You could see her.,6732.72,6733.72,7,Neil_WHO
2339, And then from the blanket down.,6733.72,6735.72,9,Neil_WHO
2340, So why isn't that just a green screen of the background image?,6735.72,6738.72,16,Neil_WHO
2341," Yeah, I think that's what it was.",6738.72,6739.72,12,Neil_WHO
2342, I think she was holding up a green blanket.,6739.72,6742.72,12,Neil_WHO
2343, I don't know how to guess.,6742.72,6743.72,10,Neil_WHO
2344, This might be it.,6743.72,6744.72,7,Neil_WHO
2345, It's dark matter.,6744.72,6745.72,7,Neil_WHO
2346," No, no, no, no, no, no, sorry, sorry, no, no, there's nothing to do with that.",6745.72,6748.72,30,Neil_WHO
2347, Okay.,6748.72,6749.72,4,Neil_WHO
2348, That's the map of dark matter in the universe.,6749.72,6752.72,13,Neil_WHO
2349, I've tried to give that a shot.,6752.72,6755.72,11,Neil_WHO
2350," No, we don't know what it is.",6755.72,6756.72,12,Neil_WHO
2351, So don't worry about it if you don't understand it.,6756.72,6758.72,15,Neil_WHO
2352," Yeah, but it's too goddamn confusing for me.",6758.72,6760.72,13,Neil_WHO
2353," No, it's not confusing at all.",6760.72,6762.72,11,Neil_WHO
2354," It's not, it's something out there that has 85% of the gravity of the universe.",6762.72,6765.72,22,Neil_WHO
2355, And we don't know what the hell it is.,6765.72,6766.72,13,Neil_WHO
2356, That's not confusing.,6766.72,6767.72,7,Neil_WHO
2357, It's not confusing.,6767.72,6768.72,7,Neil_WHO
2358," It's, it's, it's, if you don't know what that is, it's confusing by nature.",6768.72,6772.72,26,Neil_WHO
2359," Okay, I, I have more nuanced definition of confusing.",6772.72,6775.72,14,Neil_WHO
2360, Confusing is I am confused.,6775.72,6778.72,9,Neil_WHO
2361, I don't know how to think dark matter is.,6778.72,6781.72,13,Neil_WHO
2362, I don't even know what to think.,6781.72,6783.72,11,Neil_WHO
2363, I need something in my head to be confused.,6783.72,6786.72,12,Neil_WHO
2364, Right?,6786.72,6787.72,4,Neil_WHO
2365," Dark matter has, there's no, we don't know what the hell is.",6787.72,6789.72,19,Neil_WHO
2366," Do you anticipate a solution to that or some sort of a, sure, I want my eyes in and",6789.72,6794.72,23,Neil_WHO
2367," why I hope that might have been, yeah, might have been, yeah, it's not the GDT.",6794.72,6799.72,26,Neil_WHO
2368," That would be the goddamn, it's the TMT 30 meter telescope.",6799.72,6803.72,17,Neil_WHO
2369," So, yeah, solutions to, you don't know part of the, what it is to explore is not knowing",6803.72,6809.72,25,Neil_WHO
2370, what it is that you will find.,6809.72,6812.72,10,Neil_WHO
2371," And all these telescopes, the launched ones as well as the ground based ones, we have",6812.72,6817.72,20,Neil_WHO
2372, an a foresight where mature enough as a field to know that even though it's designed to,6817.72,6822.72,21,Neil_WHO
2373," look for certain things that were part of the program that you set up for it,",6822.72,6826.72,19,Neil_WHO
2374, you want to have a serendipity mode for it.,6826.72,6829.72,15,Neil_WHO
2375," You want to be able to say, let's point it in some random direction and see what shows up.",6829.72,6834.72,24,Neil_WHO
2376," Without that, you could miss something in plain sight.",6834.72,6838.72,13,Neil_WHO
2377," If you're only looking for one thing that you think is there, extrapolate it from what you knew before.",6838.72,6843.72,25,Neil_WHO
2378," And the way I think of it is, you know, there's the old saying as the area of our knowledge grows,",6843.72,6849.72,27,Neil_WHO
2379, so too does the perimeter of our ignorance.,6849.72,6854.72,11,Neil_WHO
2380," So, as that area goes, there are more places to look over the fence and stare into the abyss of ignorance that awaits you.",6854.72,6864.72,30,Neil_WHO
2381," So, dark matter is sitting on the other side of the fence.",6864.72,6870.72,16,Neil_WHO
2382, The way I've heard it describe is the bonfire of our knowledge grows brighter.,6870.72,6875.72,19,Neil_WHO
2383, The area of our ignorance is illuminated.,6875.72,6880.72,10,Neil_WHO
2384," Okay, I had to think about that.",6880.72,6884.72,11,Neil_WHO
2385, That's similar to what I said.,6884.72,6886.72,10,Neil_WHO
2386," If the bonfire is your knowledge that's lighting the way, you go see more stuff you've never noticed before.",6886.72,6894.72,26,Neil_WHO
2387, It's the same principle.,6894.72,6896.72,8,Neil_WHO
2388," That's a giant one though, man, 85%.",6896.72,6898.72,13,Neil_WHO
2389, It's 85% of gravity.,6898.72,6899.72,9,Neil_WHO
2390," So, yeah, and he adds that to the dark energy.",6899.72,6903.72,15,Neil_WHO
2391, We don't know what that is either.,6903.72,6905.72,11,Neil_WHO
2392," Dark matter, dark energy comprise 95% of everything that's driving the universe.",6905.72,6913.72,19,Neil_WHO
2393," So, everything we know and love, the chemistry, the physics, the biology, life, planets, stars, is 5% of the universe.",6913.72,6922.72,32,Neil_WHO
2394," So, people, theologians and folks say, well, maybe God is in the other 95%.",6922.72,6927.72,23,Neil_WHO
2395, Maybe.,6927.72,6928.72,4,Neil_WHO
2396," Okay, yeah.",6928.72,6929.72,6,Neil_WHO
2397, Maybe God's dark matter.,6929.72,6930.72,8,Neil_WHO
2398, Wouldn't that be crazy?,6930.72,6931.72,8,Neil_WHO
2399," Well, people say that.",6931.72,6932.72,8,Neil_WHO
2400, Surprise.,6932.72,6933.72,4,Neil_WHO
2401, Yeah.,6933.72,6934.72,4,Neil_WHO
2402," But I don't know why dark matter would care about whether, yeah.",6934.72,6939.72,17,Neil_WHO
2403, Or they're not chicks drive cars.,6939.72,6942.72,10,Neil_WHO
2404," Yeah, depending on which religion you're in, right?",6942.72,6944.72,14,Neil_WHO
2405," Yeah, all the religions got there.",6944.72,6945.72,10,Neil_WHO
2406, What are you wearing?,6945.72,6946.72,7,Neil_WHO
2407, Don't you know I'm God?,6946.72,6948.72,10,Neil_WHO
2408, What is the amount?,6948.72,6949.72,7,Neil_WHO
2409, I'm dark matter.,6949.72,6951.72,7,Neil_WHO
2410, Yeah.,6951.72,6952.72,4,Neil_WHO
2411," Um, we...",6952.72,6954.72,6,Neil_WHO
2412," Oh, by the way, just to, um, in letters from an astrophysics physicist, which isn't out yet, but again, I don't know how to hell you got the book.",6954.72,6963.72,43,Neil_WHO
2413," But it's, there's an entire chapter where I am conversing with people who are strongly religious.",6963.72,6971.72,23,Neil_WHO
2414," There's a conversation I have in there with orthodox Jewish person, a Muslim, multiple fundamentalist Christians.",6971.72,6978.72,24,Neil_WHO
2415, And we're talking about the age of the earth and why and why do we think one way or another?,6978.72,6982.72,24,Neil_WHO
2416," And so that's, there's a lot of intimate stuff in there that I generally don't go public with.",6982.72,6987.72,25,Neil_WHO
2417," But I would, did it one on one with those who had written to me about these challenges they were facing in life.",6987.72,6992.72,27,Neil_WHO
2418, And they wanted to know what an astrophysicist had to say about it.,6992.72,6995.72,20,Neil_WHO
2419, What's the youngest version of how old a religious person thinks the earth is?,6995.72,7001.72,18,Neil_WHO
2420," What's the, how, what's the...",7001.72,7003.72,12,Neil_WHO
2421, Six thousand years.,7003.72,7004.72,6,Neil_WHO
2422, Six thousand years.,7004.72,7005.72,6,Neil_WHO
2423, That's a question.,7005.72,7006.72,7,Neil_WHO
2424," Well, of all...",7006.72,7008.72,7,Neil_WHO
2425," And not all Christians, by the way.",7008.72,7010.72,11,Neil_WHO
2426," No, no, of all religions.",7010.72,7012.72,10,Neil_WHO
2427, I don't know the age...,7012.72,7014.72,9,Neil_WHO
2428, Scientologists like a month old.,7014.72,7016.72,9,Neil_WHO
2429, I don't know enough about how old all the religions think the universe is.,7016.72,7021.72,18,Neil_WHO
2430," The youngest you're going to get, the youngest universe you're going to get from a devout Christian in six thousand years.",7021.72,7027.72,28,Neil_WHO
2431, The oldest is around ten thousand.,7027.72,7029.72,9,Neil_WHO
2432, And...,7029.72,7030.72,4,Neil_WHO
2433, But it's far and away from billions.,7030.72,7032.72,11,Neil_WHO
2434, And the Mormons are a unique one because they think you get your own planet when you die.,7032.72,7036.72,22,Neil_WHO
2435," Yeah, and what's funny.",7036.72,7038.72,9,Neil_WHO
2436, Are you torn on that?,7038.72,7040.72,8,Neil_WHO
2437, What's...,7040.72,7041.72,5,Neil_WHO
2438, I want my own planet.,7041.72,7043.72,8,Neil_WHO
2439, Nobody told me that.,7043.72,7045.72,7,Neil_WHO
2440, It's odd how one religious group would comment on how preposterous another religious group's comments are.,7045.72,7054.72,23,Neil_WHO
2441, I love that.,7054.72,7055.72,6,Neil_WHO
2442," You know, I was once, I don't know if you know this, I was once quoted.",7055.72,7059.72,23,Neil_WHO
2443, I think the Scientology documentary came out on HBO and everybody was talking about it.,7059.72,7063.72,19,Neil_WHO
2444, It was clean.,7063.72,7064.72,6,Neil_WHO
2445, I think that was it.,7064.72,7065.72,8,Neil_WHO
2446, And there was a lot of chat about it for a couple of weeks.,7065.72,7068.72,17,Neil_WHO
2447," And one of the news outlets, I forgot who, called me up and said,",7068.72,7075.72,19,Neil_WHO
2448, do I think Scientology should be a religion?,7075.72,7081.72,12,Neil_WHO
2449," Classified as a religion, as an authentic religion.",7081.72,7085.72,13,Neil_WHO
2450," And you can just say, well, why are they calling me?",7085.72,7087.72,16,Neil_WHO
2451," Well, because in Scientology, they're aliens.",7087.72,7091.72,13,Neil_WHO
2452, And if they're space beings that come...,7091.72,7093.72,11,Neil_WHO
2453, You're not supposed to give up this information.,7093.72,7095.72,12,Neil_WHO
2454," Oh, sorry.",7095.72,7096.72,6,Neil_WHO
2455, No.,7096.72,7097.72,4,Neil_WHO
2456, So that's how I got brought into this conversation.,7097.72,7102.72,13,Neil_WHO
2457, Ah.,7102.72,7103.72,4,Neil_WHO
2458, Because of the sectors of Scientology that involve space beings.,7103.72,7107.72,14,Neil_WHO
2459, Okay.,7107.72,7108.72,4,Neil_WHO
2460, All right.,7108.72,7109.72,5,Neil_WHO
2461," So my answer was, we live in a country that protects the free expression.",7109.72,7116.72,18,Neil_WHO
2462, Of faith-based systems.,7116.72,7119.72,8,Neil_WHO
2463, Provided they don't subtract from the rights of others.,7119.72,7123.72,14,Neil_WHO
2464," So I will not sit here and judge whether fate ends from space,",7123.72,7133.72,16,Neil_WHO
2465," Exume souls from volcanoes, at least a third of what I just said is accurate.",7133.72,7139.72,20,Neil_WHO
2466, It's from Scientology.,7139.72,7141.72,8,Neil_WHO
2467, Or whether a man born of a woman is the son of God who died and rose from the dead.,7141.72,7151.72,23,Neil_WHO
2468, I'm not going to compare those and judge whether one of them is more authentic than another.,7151.72,7157.72,21,Neil_WHO
2469, When they're both founded on belief systems.,7157.72,7161.72,11,Neil_WHO
2470," And so in this country, belief systems are protected.",7161.72,7165.72,13,Neil_WHO
2471, And we've all bought into that.,7165.72,7167.72,10,Neil_WHO
2472," And so, you know what the headline was?",7167.72,7170.72,12,Neil_WHO
2473," Tyson defense, some knowledge.",7170.72,7172.72,8,Neil_WHO
2474, Of course.,7172.72,7173.72,5,Neil_WHO
2475, That's how you get clicks.,7173.72,7175.72,9,Neil_WHO
2476, That's what is the clickbait of my comment there.,7175.72,7178.72,14,Neil_WHO
2477, It is why I get clicks.,7178.72,7179.72,9,Neil_WHO
2478, You got to distort a little bit.,7179.72,7180.72,10,Neil_WHO
2479," There are some rational people who in the comment thread said,",7180.72,7184.72,14,Neil_WHO
2480, that's not what he said.,7184.72,7185.72,9,Neil_WHO
2481, Of course.,7185.72,7186.72,5,Neil_WHO
2482, Yeah.,7186.72,7187.72,4,Neil_WHO
2483," But isn't it more interesting when they do do that and then inside the actual article itself,",7187.72,7190.72,21,Neil_WHO
2484, they give your full quote so people can see the deception.,7190.72,7193.72,14,Neil_WHO
2485, The real confusing thing is when they take a chunk of your quote and they can take it out of context.,7193.72,7198.72,24,Neil_WHO
2486, So you know what I do?,7198.72,7200.72,9,Neil_WHO
2487, You're going to jail for that by the way.,7200.72,7202.72,13,Neil_WHO
2488," Well, so that's interesting.",7202.72,7203.72,9,Neil_WHO
2489," So for me, I'm an observer of that, not a complainer about it.",7203.72,7207.72,20,Neil_WHO
2490, So how they're doing it.,7207.72,7209.72,9,Neil_WHO
2491," Okay, so maybe I can shape this phrase differently to minimize the chance of that happening in the future.",7209.72,7214.72,23,Neil_WHO
2492, Minimize the chance of you being lied about.,7214.72,7216.72,12,Neil_WHO
2493, Correct.,7216.72,7217.72,4,Neil_WHO
2494," So for me, that is a landscape.",7217.72,7219.72,11,Neil_WHO
2495, There's some landmines here.,7219.72,7220.72,10,Neil_WHO
2496, There's some trap doors here.,7220.72,7222.72,9,Neil_WHO
2497, There's something.,7222.72,7223.72,6,Neil_WHO
2498," And so for me, one who communicates on that landscape, that's just information for me to navigate it slightly more nimbly in the future.",7223.72,7235.72,32,Neil_WHO
2499, Right.,7235.72,7236.72,4,Neil_WHO
2500, Yeah.,7236.72,7237.72,4,Neil_WHO
2501, Got it.,7237.72,7238.72,5,Neil_WHO
2502, Interesting.,7238.72,7239.72,4,Neil_WHO
2503, Gravity.,7239.72,7240.72,4,Neil_WHO
2504, There's one thing that I want to talk about.,7240.72,7241.72,13,Neil_WHO
2505, You still hook up on gravity.,7241.72,7242.72,9,Neil_WHO
2506, Yes.,7242.72,7243.72,4,Neil_WHO
2507, I'm always hooked up on gravity.,7243.72,7244.72,10,Neil_WHO
2508, Because as you should be.,7244.72,7247.72,8,Neil_WHO
2509," Well, since we've talked last, I've been reading a lot about it.",7247.72,7250.72,19,Neil_WHO
2510, And one of the things that confuses me the most is that we don't really understand what gravity is.,7250.72,7255.72,24,Neil_WHO
2511, We know its effects.,7255.72,7257.72,7,Neil_WHO
2512, We can measure them.,7257.72,7258.72,7,Neil_WHO
2513, We know how to measure them.,7258.72,7260.72,9,Neil_WHO
2514, We know what the mass is involved.,7260.72,7264.72,10,Neil_WHO
2515, But we don't really know what gravity is.,7264.72,7266.72,12,Neil_WHO
2516, There's a similar question in the book.,7266.72,7268.72,11,Neil_WHO
2517, But they got a little more philosophical than you just did.,7268.72,7271.72,14,Neil_WHO
2518, But they both lean philosophical.,7271.72,7273.72,8,Neil_WHO
2519, It's science can describe how gravity works.,7273.72,7277.72,11,Neil_WHO
2520, But can they describe why it works?,7277.72,7280.72,10,Neil_WHO
2521, Can we?,7280.72,7281.72,5,Neil_WHO
2522, So this is the how-why duality here.,7281.72,7285.72,13,Neil_WHO
2523, And allow me to just answer it from a how-why point of view.,7285.72,7289.72,18,Neil_WHO
2524, And then we can apply it to gravity after I say that.,7289.72,7292.72,15,Neil_WHO
2525," In science, if we can describe how something works and predict its future behavior,",7292.72,7297.72,18,Neil_WHO
2526, we claim to understand it and we move on.,7297.72,7300.72,12,Neil_WHO
2527, You can ask deeper question about why is their gravity?,7300.72,7304.72,13,Neil_WHO
2528, What is the meaning?,7304.72,7305.72,7,Neil_WHO

2533, So I'm not distracted by the more philosophical side of that.,7320.72,7325.72,15,Neil_WHO
2534, Why does it work?,7325.72,7327.72,7,Neil_WHO
2535, Okay.,7327.72,7328.72,4,Neil_WHO
2536, Einstein.,7328.72,7330.72,4,Neil_WHO

2538," in which he coined the phrase, action at a distance.",7334.72,7337.72,14,Neil_WHO
2539, Okay?,7337.72,7338.72,4,Neil_WHO
2540, He wrote down the equation that worked.,7338.72,7342.72,10,Neil_WHO
2541," He walked into the equation, the moon goes around the earth, earth goes on the sun.",7342.72,7345.72,21,Neil_WHO
2542, The moons of Jupiter go around Jupiter.,7345.72,7348.72,10,Neil_WHO
2543, He accurately described that with his equations of gravity.,7348.72,7353.72,12,Neil_WHO
2544, Okay.,7353.72,7354.72,4,Neil_WHO
2545," He said, one day I think we're going to find some way that they're connecting to each other,",7354.72,7359.72,24,Neil_WHO

2555," Gravity is the curvature of space and time,",7381.72,7386.72,11,Neil_WHO
2556, and you're moving on the curvature of that fabric.,7386.72,7389.72,13,Neil_WHO
2557, That's gravity.,7389.72,7391.72,6,Neil_WHO
2558," Oh my gosh, is it even a force then?",7391.72,7394.72,13,Neil_WHO

2562," In fact, that's where I met my wife in relativity class in graduate school.",7409.72,7416.72,19,Neil_WHO
2563, It's space.,7416.72,7419.72,6,Neil_WHO
2564, So matter tells space how to curve.,7419.72,7422.72,10,Neil_WHO
2565, Space tells matter how to move.,7422.72,7426.72,9,Neil_WHO
2566, It moves along the curvature of space.,7426.72,7429.72,10,Neil_WHO
2567, You don't need an action at a distance.,7429.72,7431.72,12,Neil_WHO

2583, That's fine.,7486.72,7488.72,6,Neil_WHO

2590, Why did it...,7508.72,7509.72,6,Neil_WHO
2591, There's a point where it's not especially productive to continue to think about the world that way.,7509.72,7517.72,22,Neil_WHO
2592," Because what I'm claiming is answers to the how, when you understand the how enough,",7517.72,7526.72,20,Neil_WHO

2594, That's what I'm telling you.,7531.72,7532.72,10,Neil_WHO
2595, T tan amount in terms of your ability to measure it and accurately use it.,7532.72,7536.72,18,Neil_WHO
2596, Correct.,7536.72,7537.72,4,Neil_WHO
2597," So we can say, okay.",7537.72,7538.72,9,Neil_WHO
2598, But isn't it so serious?,7538.72,7539.72,9,Neil_WHO
2599, You've got a ball.,7539.72,7540.72,8,Neil_WHO
2600," We can say, well, why did you go bald?",7540.72,7542.72,14,Neil_WHO

2604, Yeah.,7549.72,7550.72,4,Neil_WHO
2605, That's common.,7550.72,7551.72,6,Neil_WHO
2606," If you have your hair when you're 30, you'll probably have it for the rest of your life.",7551.72,7555.72,24,Neil_WHO

2608, You start losing it up right going up to your 30s.,7557.72,7559.72,15,Neil_WHO
2609," So you can say, well, the hair follicle begins to not producing the keratin or whatever.",7559.72,7564.72,23,Neil_WHO
2610, We get the explanation.,7564.72,7565.72,7,Neil_WHO
2611," Then you say, well, why does the hair follicle stop doing that?",7565.72,7569.72,18,Neil_WHO
2612," Then you say, oh, well, because the DNA has pre-coded about the hair kind of thing.",7569.72,7575.72,25,Neil_WHO
2613," Well, why does the DNA have the hair?",7575.72,7578.72,12,Neil_WHO
2614," Well, because so...",7578.72,7580.72,7,Neil_WHO
2615, But we know far more about how and why people go bald than we do about what gravity really is.,7580.72,7587.72,23,Neil_WHO
2616, Correct.,7587.72,7588.72,4,Neil_WHO
2617, And telling you gravity really is the curvature of space and time.,7588.72,7594.72,15,Neil_WHO

2619," It's a space and time, but it's also based on mass, right?",7598.72,7600.72,19,Neil_WHO

2621, If any concentration of matter and energy and or energy will curve the fabric of space and time.,7602.72,7607.72,21,Neil_WHO

2623," And the movement of matter on that fabric of space and time, we call gravity.",7609.72,7617.72,19,Neil_WHO
2624, And I'm good with that.,7617.72,7618.72,9,Neil_WHO
2625, Okay.,7618.72,7619.72,4,Neil_WHO
2626, But you seem a little oddly defensive about something that's scientific.,7619.72,7623.72,15,Neil_WHO
2627," No, I have to say I'm good with it.",7623.72,7625.72,14,Neil_WHO

2632, That's what you're saying.,7632.72,7633.72,9,Neil_WHO
2633," No, I'm saying, why does matter and energy curve the fabric of space and time.",7633.72,7638.72,21,Neil_WHO

2639," Okay, you don't need to know why.",7645.72,7647.72,12,Neil_WHO
2640, I got you to the point.,7647.72,7648.72,9,Neil_WHO
2641, Right.,7648.72,7649.72,4,Neil_WHO
2642, We had to walk to that point where your why got unanswered.,7649.72,7654.72,17,Neil_WHO
2643, I understand that.,7654.72,7655.72,6,Neil_WHO
2644," But before we got to that point, I answered otherwise.",7655.72,7658.72,14,Neil_WHO
2645, But I'm not disputing that.,7658.72,7659.72,10,Neil_WHO

2647, Good.,7660.72,7661.72,4,Neil_WHO
2648, So what I'm telling you is that I can answer your why question most of the time.,7661.72,7665.72,21,Neil_WHO
2649, But then you'll come back to a point where there's a point where there's the why doesn't have the answer.,7665.72,7671.72,27,Neil_WHO
2650, So you say why did it fall?,7671.72,7673.72,10,Neil_WHO
2651, I say there's a force of gravity operating on it.,7673.72,7675.72,14,Neil_WHO
2652, Why did it fall that way?,7675.72,7676.72,9,Neil_WHO
2653, Because the curvature is space and time.,7676.72,7678.72,10,Neil_WHO
2654, I'm answering your why's.,7678.72,7679.72,9,Neil_WHO
2655, I understand.,7679.72,7680.72,5,Neil_WHO
2656, Then why does matter and energy curve space and time?,7680.72,7684.72,13,Neil_WHO
2657," Okay, that's a frontier.",7684.72,7685.72,9,Neil_WHO
2658, We're still working on that.,7685.72,7687.72,9,Neil_WHO
2659, But that's all I'm asking.,7687.72,7688.72,10,Neil_WHO
2660, That's good.,7688.72,7689.72,6,Neil_WHO
2661, That's fine.,7689.72,7690.72,6,Neil_WHO
2662, You are a man of science.,7690.72,7691.72,9,Neil_WHO

2667," Oh, okay.",7705.72,7706.72,6,Neil_WHO
2668, I don't know if there's purpose or anything.,7706.72,7708.72,13,Neil_WHO
2669, Why did you bang the table?,7708.72,7709.72,9,Neil_WHO
2670, I was angry.,7709.72,7710.72,6,Neil_WHO
2671, There's a purpose behind it.,7710.72,7711.72,9,Neil_WHO
2672, That's the things.,7711.72,7712.72,7,Neil_WHO
2673," So if your why is just a curiosity of what's going on, that's one thing.",7712.72,7719.72,21,Neil_WHO
2674," If you are inquiring about purpose, then it's theological.",7719.72,7724.72,15,Neil_WHO

2676," Clearly, I'm not doing that.",7728.72,7729.72,10,Neil_WHO

2721, He's there.,7830.72,7831.72,6,Neil_WHO
2722, Gravity's going to beat that motherfucker.,7831.72,7832.72,10,Neil_WHO
2723, Let me tell you.,7832.72,7833.72,7,Neil_WHO
2724," Eventually, but while he's there, he's conquer in gravity.",7833.72,7838.72,16,Neil_WHO
2725, Are you getting too old?,7838.72,7839.72,8,Neil_WHO
2726, You haven't conquered gravity lately?,7839.72,7841.72,9,Neil_WHO
2727," No, I work out all the time.",7841.72,7842.72,11,Neil_WHO
2728, I'm not buying it.,7842.72,7843.72,8,Neil_WHO
2729, No!,7843.72,7844.72,4,Neil_WHO
2730, That's sick.,7844.72,7845.72,6,Neil_WHO
2731, I ain't conquered shit.,7845.72,7846.72,8,Neil_WHO
2732, He's pulling rank now.,7846.72,7847.72,8,Neil_WHO
2733, I work out and you don't because I see your middle-aged man belly.,7847.72,7853.72,19,Neil_WHO
2734, When I've talked to other astrophysicists and scientists.,7853.72,7859.72,16,Neil_WHO
2735," Let me ask, are these conversations supposed to have a theme or a purpose?",7859.72,7864.72,18,Neil_WHO
2736," Or is it just you sit there and just whatever comes your head, you send my word?",7864.72,7867.72,21,Neil_WHO
2737, Are you in me?,7867.72,7868.72,7,Neil_WHO
2738, Yeah.,7868.72,7869.72,4,Neil_WHO
2739, I don't know.,7869.72,7870.72,7,Neil_WHO
2740, I don't know.,7870.72,7871.72,7,Neil_WHO
2741, How do you say this episode is about?,7871.72,7873.72,11,Neil_WHO
2742, You can't say that.,7873.72,7874.72,8,Neil_WHO
2743, I don't ever do that.,7874.72,7875.72,9,Neil_WHO
2744, You don't do that.,7875.72,7876.72,8,Neil_WHO
2745, Okay.,7876.72,7877.72,4,Neil_WHO
2746, It's just episode number secret to my success.,7877.72,7878.72,12,Neil_WHO
2747, I don't know.,7878.72,7879.72,7,Neil_WHO
2748, You got no commitments.,7879.72,7880.72,7,Neil_WHO
2749, How the fuck can I ever have a threat?,7880.72,7883.72,12,Neil_WHO
2750, Think about all the different people I have here.,7883.72,7885.72,12,Neil_WHO
2751, Of course.,7885.72,7886.72,5,Neil_WHO
2752, It's like impossible between fighters and scientists and scholars and crack pots.,7886.72,7891.72,16,Neil_WHO
2753," There's a bunch of different people coming through here, man.",7891.72,7894.72,15,Neil_WHO
2754, I can't have any agenda.,7894.72,7895.72,9,Neil_WHO
2755, All right.,7895.72,7896.72,5,Neil_WHO
2756," I mean, that's probably the only reason why this thing is successful as it is.",7896.72,7901.72,20,Neil_WHO
2757, But that's a weird one for people.,7901.72,7903.72,11,Neil_WHO
2758, That this one thing that is so powerful.,7903.72,7906.72,11,Neil_WHO
2759, What is?,7906.72,7907.72,5,Neil_WHO
2760," Oh, gravity.",7907.72,7908.72,6,Neil_WHO
2761, That's a weird one for people.,7908.72,7909.72,10,Neil_WHO
2762, Yeah.,7909.72,7910.72,4,Neil_WHO
2763," I mean, it seems like you're frustrated by all the various questions.",7910.72,7913.72,17,Neil_WHO
2764," No, no.",7913.72,7914.72,6,Neil_WHO
2765, You seem a little defensive there.,7914.72,7916.72,9,Neil_WHO
2766," No, because I thought you were taking your why to ultimately mean purpose.",7916.72,7920.72,17,Neil_WHO
2767," No, no.",7920.72,7921.72,6,Neil_WHO
2768, Why?,7921.72,7922.72,4,Neil_WHO
2769, I'm claiming that many responses to how are also responses to a why.,7922.72,7928.72,17,Neil_WHO
2770, That's the point I'm making.,7928.72,7931.72,10,Neil_WHO
2771, And I don't like splitting definitions.,7931.72,7934.72,10,Neil_WHO
2772," Well, ultimately, understanding gravity.",7934.72,7936.72,9,Neil_WHO
2773, I think we do.,7936.72,7937.72,7,Neil_WHO
2774, That's why we can land things on Mars.,7937.72,7939.72,12,Neil_WHO
2775, We understand that.,7939.72,7940.72,6,Neil_WHO
2776," I think we do, which is why your cell phone gets time from GPS satellites that is pre-corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity,",7940.72,7949.72,33,Neil_WHO
2777, because they're in a different gravitational field than you orbit than you are on Earth's surface.,7949.72,7954.72,21,Neil_WHO
2778, We got this.,7954.72,7955.72,6,Neil_WHO
2779, You're getting angry.,7955.72,7956.72,7,Neil_WHO
2780, No.,7956.72,7957.72,4,Neil_WHO
2781, We're running short on time here.,7957.72,7960.72,10,Neil_WHO
2782, So I set you something that I wanted to ask you.,7960.72,7965.72,14,Neil_WHO
2783, What's that?,7965.72,7966.72,6,Neil_WHO
2784, I sent you an email.,7966.72,7967.72,8,Neil_WHO
2785, Did you get that email?,7967.72,7968.72,8,Neil_WHO
2786," Oh, I did.",7968.72,7969.72,7,Neil_WHO
2787, I did.,7969.72,7970.72,5,Neil_WHO
2788, It was about a black hole that landed in a mysterious place in our understandings.,7970.72,7973.72,19,Neil_WHO
2789, Yes.,7973.72,7974.72,4,Neil_WHO
2790, Yeah.,7974.72,7975.72,4,Neil_WHO
2791, Let me just give the readers' digest version of this.,7975.72,7982.72,14,Neil_WHO
2792, There are black holes that are formed at the consequence of the death of stars.,7982.72,7995.72,18,Neil_WHO
2793," We think we understand the formation of stars well enough to say,",7995.72,7998.72,15,Neil_WHO
2794," well, stars are born with this much mass, and it'll lose certain amount of mass over its life,",7998.72,8003.72,24,Neil_WHO
2795," all stars lose mass, because there's so much pressure and so much energy coming out.",8003.72,8007.72,20,Neil_WHO
2796, It carries particles with it.,8007.72,8009.72,8,Neil_WHO
2797, So they lose mass.,8009.72,8010.72,7,Neil_WHO
2798, The sun is losing mass.,8010.72,8012.72,8,Neil_WHO
2799," As we speak, it's called the solar wind.",8012.72,8014.72,13,Neil_WHO
2800, So everybody loses mass out there.,8014.72,8016.72,9,Neil_WHO
2801," The question is, at what rate are you losing mass?",8016.72,8018.72,14,Neil_WHO
2802, Is it a lot compared to your total mass?,8018.72,8021.72,12,Neil_WHO
2803, Is it small?,8021.72,8022.72,6,Neil_WHO
2804, So very high mass stars are not especially stable objects.,8022.72,8027.72,13,Neil_WHO
2805," They remain stars for 100,000 at most in million years, and they'll explode and become a supernova.",8027.72,8035.72,25,Neil_WHO
2806," If you're more massive than that, they will not explode because the gravity is so strong",8035.72,8040.72,20,Neil_WHO
2807, that it cannot explode against the strength of the gravity and it collapses into a black hole.,8040.72,8045.72,20,Neil_WHO
2808," So we expect black holes to have slightly less mass, somewhat less mass,",8045.72,8052.72,17,Neil_WHO
2809, than the most massive stars that we know how to make.,8052.72,8056.72,14,Neil_WHO
2810," So if you have 100 times the mass of the sun star, it'll lose half its mass over its life,",8056.72,8063.72,25,Neil_WHO
2811, and you have a black hole that's 30 times the mass of the sun or 50 times the mass of the sun.,8063.72,8069.72,26,Neil_WHO
2812, Fine.,8069.72,8070.72,4,Neil_WHO
2813, Put a pin in that.,8070.72,8071.72,8,Neil_WHO
2814," In the centers of galaxies, there are supermassive black holes.",8071.72,8075.72,16,Neil_WHO
2815," Hundreds of thousands, millions times the mass of the sun.",8075.72,8080.72,14,Neil_WHO
2816," And we call it their supermassive, and there are black holes we call them supermassive black holes,",8080.72,8085.72,25,Neil_WHO
2817, and that's how we roll as astrophysicists.,8085.72,8088.72,15,Neil_WHO
2818, Alright.,8088.72,8089.72,4,Neil_WHO
2819," Well, could you have black holes somewhere in the middle of these two extremes?",8089.72,8094.72,18,Neil_WHO
2820, We do not know a phenomenon that will give you a black hole that's in between these two categories.,8094.72,8108.72,23,Neil_WHO
2821, You can make a black hole that eats its way there.,8108.72,8111.72,14,Neil_WHO
2822, Fine.,8111.72,8112.72,4,Neil_WHO
2823, But we don't know how to make one.,8112.72,8115.72,12,Neil_WHO
2824," And we think we, my colleagues who've done this, I think they've discovered a black hole that is sitting in this sort of nether world,",8115.72,8124.72,33,Neil_WHO
2825, where there's no evidence that it ate to become that massive.,8124.72,8129.72,15,Neil_WHO
2826," And we don't know how to explain it by the formation and death of stars,",8129.72,8133.72,19,Neil_WHO
2827, and is nowhere near the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy.,8133.72,8137.72,19,Neil_WHO
2828, So it's the frontier of research at this moment.,8137.72,8140.72,13,Neil_WHO
2829, So it's just a newly discovered type of black hole here?,8141.72,8144.72,15,Neil_WHO
2830," It's in a mass regime that they physically impossible, you know, headlines,",8144.72,8149.72,18,Neil_WHO
2831," we're reading the headline now, black hole shock.",8149.72,8152.72,13,Neil_WHO
2832," Show me the, where this appears?",8152.72,8156.72,10,Neil_WHO
2833," Express, so this is a British.",8156.72,8158.72,10,Neil_WHO
2834, I think they're British.,8158.72,8160.72,8,Neil_WHO
2835," Anyhow, it's a news digest for science.",8160.72,8162.72,13,Neil_WHO
2836, So black hole shock theories swirl around the discovery of a physically impossible black hole.,8162.72,8168.72,18,Neil_WHO
2837, So scientists don't use the word impossible unless it's violating a known law of physics.,8168.72,8174.72,20,Neil_WHO
2838, So I bet that was a editor's title.,8174.72,8179.72,12,Neil_WHO
2839, And I don't have a problem.,8179.72,8180.72,10,Neil_WHO
2840, I don't mind a little bit of sensationalism there.,8180.72,8182.72,14,Neil_WHO
2841," You can say it is a black hole that comes from an, if it comes from an object,",8182.72,8187.72,22,Neil_WHO
2842, it is an object we know nothing about and have yet to discover.,8187.72,8191.72,16,Neil_WHO
2843, We're not going to say it's an impossible object.,8191.72,8193.720000000001,14,Neil_WHO
2844," Every time we point the telescope to the universe, we find something that we never predicted or understood.",8193.72,8199.72,22,Neil_WHO
2845, And it adds to the knowledge base that we already have whenever they do discover things.,8199.72,8203.72,19,Neil_WHO
2846," And then it becomes what we know and understand, like the supermassive black holes at the center of every galaxy.",8203.72,8210.72,26,Neil_WHO
2847, That was a fairly recent discovery in terms of hypocurism.,8210.72,8213.72,16,Neil_WHO
2848, It was hypothesized because we saw the centers of galaxies behaving really weirdly.,8213.72,8217.72,17,Neil_WHO
2849, Things stars were moving faster than they should have given how much gravity was tugging on them.,8217.72,8222.72,21,Neil_WHO
2850," And we said, dude, something's got to be there.",8222.72,8225.72,15,Neil_WHO
2851, And it's got to be really small because we're tracking stars really close to the middle.,8225.72,8230.72,21,Neil_WHO
2852," Well, if it was made of ordinary matter, how big it would have to be really, really big.",8230.72,8235.72,24,Neil_WHO
2853," So this has to be really, really small in order for this to happen.",8235.72,8238.72,18,Neil_WHO
2854, The only thing we know that could fill that small volume and have that much gravity is a black hole.,8238.72,8242.72,23,Neil_WHO
2855, So it was suspected for a long time.,8242.72,8244.72,11,Neil_WHO
2856," It was confirmed that as a common thing by the Hubble telescope and first photographed by this recent research,",8244.72,8251.72,22,Neil_WHO
2857, this recent result in the galaxy M87.,8251.72,8254.72,11,Neil_WHO
2858, Messier 87 is what it's name of the galaxy.,8254.72,8257.72,14,Neil_WHO
2859, And you can determine how big the black hole is based on the size of the galaxy.,8257.72,8262.72,20,Neil_WHO
2860, We can determine the mass of the black hole by how fast stars are moving at the distance they are from it.,8262.72,8267.72,25,Neil_WHO
2861," So in other words, so we're earth orbiting the Sun.",8267.72,8271.72,15,Neil_WHO
2862, We have a certain speed.,8271.72,8272.72,8,Neil_WHO
2863," We're going about, I forgot how to do it.",8272.72,8275.72,14,Neil_WHO
2864, What?,8275.72,8276.72,4,Neil_WHO
2865, 18 miles per second.,8276.72,8278.72,7,Neil_WHO
2866, I think that's the number.,8278.72,8279.72,9,Neil_WHO
2867, 30 kilometers a second.,8279.72,8280.72,7,Neil_WHO
2868, That's our speed around the Sun.,8280.72,8283.72,10,Neil_WHO
2869, That's pretty fast.,8283.72,8284.72,7,Neil_WHO
2870, Okay?,8284.72,8285.72,4,Neil_WHO
2871," If the Sun had more mass, instantly, that speed is not enough to maintain our orbit.",8285.72,8294.72,21,Neil_WHO
2872, And we'll start spiraling in towards it.,8294.72,8297.72,12,Neil_WHO
2873," If the Sun had less mass, that speed is too high to be in this orbit.",8297.72,8305.72,20,Neil_WHO
2874," It'll take it to a, sorry, it's too fast to maintain this orbit.",8305.72,8308.72,20,Neil_WHO
2875," It'll climb us out to a higher orbit, slow us down, and it will be in a higher orbit with a slower speed.",8308.72,8315.72,29,Neil_WHO
2876," So in other words, for any object, at any distance, there's only one speed you can maintain and have a stable orbit around it.",8315.72,8323.72,31,Neil_WHO
2877," So when we see stars orbiting something in the center of the galaxy, it is a straightforward astro 102 equation to calculate how much mass the thing is orbiting.",8323.72,8334.72,34,Neil_WHO
2878, And you get the mass and you can't see it.,8334.72,8337.72,14,Neil_WHO
2879, It's small.,8337.72,8338.72,6,Neil_WHO
2880, It's a black hole.,8338.72,8340.72,8,Neil_WHO
2881," And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the end of the podcast.",8340.72,8343.72,16,Neil_WHO
2882," This book will be available when, sir.",8343.72,8346.72,11,Neil_WHO
2883," It comes out in October, first week of October.",8346.72,8348.72,13,Neil_WHO
2884, I'm very proud of this book.,8348.72,8350.72,10,Neil_WHO
2885, It's my most heartfelt thing that I've ever done.,8350.72,8353.72,14,Neil_WHO
2886," Well, when it comes out, I will take a photograph and put it up on the Instagram and the Twitter.",8353.72,8357.72,25,Neil_WHO
2887, Everybody know about it.,8357.72,8358.72,7,Neil_WHO
2888," Yeah, and it's a, it also has letters from people in prison.",8358.72,8363.72,18,Neil_WHO
2889," A person who just learned that they were, had terminal cancer.",8363.72,8367.72,15,Neil_WHO
2890," I mean, there's a lot of people reaching out.",8367.72,8369.72,14,Neil_WHO
2891, Just responding to letters.,8369.72,8371.72,7,Neil_WHO
2892," Yes, it's me responding.",8371.72,8372.72,9,Neil_WHO
2893," And their letters, I can't fit all of their letters. Some are very long tones.",8372.72,8375.72,21,Neil_WHO
2894," But most of the letters, their letters, and then all of my correspondences in there.",8375.72,8379.72,21,Neil_WHO
2895, So it's my most heartfelt contribution to this universe.,8379.72,8383.72,13,Neil_WHO
2896, And StarTalk is still a podcast.,8383.72,8385.72,10,Neil_WHO
2897, We're still going.,8385.72,8386.72,7,Neil_WHO
2898, Still going.,8386.72,8387.72,5,Neil_WHO
2899, StarTalk would pump it up 50 episodes.,8387.72,8389.72,11,Neil_WHO
2900, And it's television show.,8389.72,8391.72,8,Neil_WHO
2901," Yeah, so we're, we can see if we're going to have a new season.",8391.72,8394.72,21,Neil_WHO
2902, We don't know yet.,8394.72,8395.72,8,Neil_WHO
2903, That's to be announced.,8395.72,8396.72,8,Neil_WHO
2904, But we're going.,8396.72,8397.72,7,Neil_WHO
2905, So it's always a podcast and we got a YouTube channel.,8397.72,8400.72,15,Neil_WHO
2906, StarTalk YouTube channel.,8400.72,8402.72,7,Neil_WHO
2907, And we're thinking of branching out into other kinds of educational product that's still fun and comedic and the like.,8402.72,8409.72,27,Neil_WHO
2908, And I love your support for this because you're also a comedian.,8409.72,8413.72,16,Neil_WHO
2909, So you know the value.,8413.72,8414.72,8,Neil_WHO
2910, And I love comedians that have their fundamental part of how we deliver a science to the public on StarTalk.,8414.72,8419.72,25,Neil_WHO
2911, So thanks for for that plug.,8419.72,8421.72,9,Neil_WHO
2912," My pleasure, my friend.",8421.72,8422.72,8,Neil_WHO
2913," Dude, thank you.",8422.72,8423.72,7,Neil_WHO
