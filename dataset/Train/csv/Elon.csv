0, The following is a conversation with Elon Musk his third time on this the Lex Friedman podcast,0.0,6.0,20,Elon
1," Yeah, make yourself comfortable. Oh wow, okay",6.96,10.16,12,Elon
2," Did you don't do the headphone thing? No, okay. I mean hot clothes so I get me to get the same clothes",11.040000000000001,15.92,28,Elon
3," The clothes you are the sexiest son. Hey babe. Yeah, yeah, I get enough of the oil. Oh, baby",15.92,20.72,28,Elon
4, I'm gonna clip that out,22.88,24.88,8,Elon
5, Anytime somebody messes with me about you,25.119999999999997,27.119999999999997,10,Elon
6, You watch the party and you think I'm sexy come right out and tell me so,27.119999999999997,31.919999999999998,19,Elon
7, So good okay serious mode activate all right,38.8,42.08,10,Elon
8," The serious mode come on your Russian you can be serious. Yeah, everyone's serious. All the time in Russia. Yeah",43.28,47.92,27,Elon
9," Yeah, we'll get we'll get there. We'll get there",48.56,51.2,16,Elon
10," Yeah, it's gotten soft",52.32,54.32,8,Elon
11, Allow me to say that the space X launch of human beings to orbit on May 30th 2020,55.28,60.800000000000004,21,Elon
12, Was seen by many as the first step in a new era of human space exploration,62.080000000000005,66.48,18,Elon
13, These human spaceflight missions were a beacon of hope to me and to millions over the past two years,67.44,72.64,22,Elon
14, Is our world has been going through one of the most difficult periods in recent human history,72.64,77.12,19,Elon
15, We saw we see the rise of division fear cynicism and the loss of common humanity,78.08,83.92,19,Elon
16, Right when it is needed most so first,84.64,87.2,10,Elon
17," Elon, let me say thank you for giving the world hope and reason to be excited about the future. Oh, it's kind of you to say",87.76,93.36,32,Elon
18, I do want to do that humanity has,94.16,96.16,10,Elon
19, obviously a lot of issues and and,97.2,99.2,9,Elon
20," You know people at times do do bad things, but you know despite all that",100.08,105.04,18,Elon
21," You know, I love humanity and I think we should",106.0,108.4,13,Elon
22, Uh,109.12,111.12,3,Elon
23, Make sure we do everything we can to have a good future and an exciting future and one where that maximizes the happiness of the people,111.12,117.36000000000001,29,Elon
24, Let me ask about the coup dragon demo 2 so that that first flight with humans on board,118.32000000000001,123.28,20,Elon
25, How did you feel leading up to that launch? We scared. Are you excited? I was going through your mind so much was it stake,124.4,131.12,30,Elon
26," Yeah, no, that was extremely stressful no question. Um, we obviously could not",132.08,138.08,19,Elon
27," Um, let them down in any way um, so",139.04,142.0,13,Elon
28, Extremely stressful I'd say uh to say at least,144.0,146.88,13,Elon
29, But we did I was confident that at the time that we launched that,147.68,151.12,16,Elon
30, No one could think of anything,152.08,154.08,8,Elon
31," Uh, at all to do that would improve the probability of success",154.64000000000001,158.48000000000002,15,Elon
32," Um, and we we racked our brains to think of any possible way to improve the probability of success",159.44,164.64,23,Elon
33, We cannot think of anything more and and nor could NASA and so,164.79999999999998,168.39999999999998,15,Elon
34, Then that's just the best that we could do so then we we had,169.92,172.72,17,Elon
35, We went ahead and launched,173.67999999999998,175.67999999999998,7,Elon
36, Now I'm not a religious person,175.67999999999998,177.67999999999998,9,Elon
37," Um, but I nonetheless got on my knees and prayed for for that mission",178.32,182.23999999999998,17,Elon
38, We able to sleep,183.76,185.76,6,Elon
39, no,185.83999999999997,187.6,3,Elon
40, How did I feel when it was a success first when the launch was a success and when they returned back home or back to earth,187.6,195.44,28,Elon
41, There's a great relief,196.88,198.88,7,Elon
42," Yeah, it is for for high-striest situations. I find it's it's not so much elation as relief",200.4,205.84,28,Elon
43, um,206.64,208.64,3,Elon
44," And um, you know, I think once as we got more comfortable and proved out the systems because you know, we really",208.64,216.24,27,Elon
45," Um, you know, you got to make sure everything works um, I was it was definitely a lot more enjoyable with the subsequent",217.20000000000002,223.84,28,Elon
46," uh, astronaut missions and I thought the",224.56,227.60000000000002,10,Elon
47," The inspiration mission was was actually very inspiring um inspiration for mission um, I'd encourage people to watch the",228.8,235.28,23,Elon
48, Inspiration documentary on Netflix. It's actually really good um,235.92000000000002,239.28,14,Elon
49, And it really isn't so I was actually inspired by that um and I a,240.24,244.4,18,Elon
50, I so that when I felt I was kind of able to enjoy the the actual mission and not just be able to rest all the time,245.04,250.72,29,Elon
51, So for people that somehow don't know it's the all civilian first time all civilian out the space thought to orbit,250.96,258.8,25,Elon
52," Yeah, and it was that high I think the highest",259.36,261.36,13,Elon
53, orbit that uh in like an 30 or 40 years or something the only one that was higher,262.16,267.04,20,Elon
54, Was this one shuttle or sorry a Hubble uh servicing mission um and then before that it would have been,267.84000000000003,273.84000000000003,23,Elon
55, Apollo in 72,274.56,276.4,5,Elon
56, It's very wild,277.84,279.12,6,Elon
57," So it's cool. It's got you know, I think uh, you know as uh as the species like we want to be you know continuing to",279.12,286.88,33,Elon
58, Do better and reach higher ground and and like I think it would be tragic extremely tragic if um,287.52,293.59999999999997,21,Elon
59," Apollo was the high watermark for humanity, you know, and that and that's as far as we ever got um and it's um",294.0,300.79999999999995,30,Elon
60, It's concerning that here we are,301.76,303.76,9,Elon
61, 49 years after the last mission to the moon and so almost half a century,305.52000000000004,311.04,17,Elon
62," Uh, and we've not been back",311.84000000000003,313.84000000000003,10,Elon
63," Um, and that's that's worrying. It's like is that does that mean we've peaked as a civilization or what so",314.16,321.2,29,Elon
64," Like I think we got to get back to the moon and and bullet base there, you know a science base",322.64,327.04,24,Elon
65, I think we could learn a lot about the nature of the universe if we have a proper science base on the moon,327.12,331.52000000000004,25,Elon
66, um,332.16,333.04,3,Elon
67, You know like we have a science base in Antarctica and you know many other parts of world and,333.04,338.40000000000003,21,Elon
68, um,338.40000000000003,339.44,3,Elon
69, So that that that's like I think the next big thing we've got to have like a a serious like moon base um and then get people to Mars and,339.44,347.28000000000003,34,Elon
70, You know get get out there and be a space-bearing civilization. I'll ask you about some of those details,348.56,354.24,26,Elon
71, But since you're so busy with the hard engineering challenges of everything that's involved,354.48,359.68,18,Elon
72, I you're still able to marvel at the magic of at all of space travel,360.16,363.84000000000003,18,Elon
73, Of every time the rocket goes up especially when it's a crude mission,364.48,367.2,16,Elon
74, Are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges that you have to solve,368.08,372.32,16,Elon
75, And actually sort of to add to that,373.44,375.52,10,Elon
76, The reason I wanted to ask this question of may 30th. It's it's been some time so you can look back and think about the impact already,376.16,383.2,33,Elon
77, It's already at the time. It was an engineering problem. Maybe now it's becoming a historic moment,383.52,389.12,23,Elon
78, Like it's a moment that,389.28,390.88,8,Elon
79, How many moments will be remembered about the 21st century to me,390.88,394.08,15,Elon
80, That or something like that maybe inspiration for one of those will be remembered as the early steps of a new age of uh space exploration,395.59999999999997,403.2,28,Elon
81," Yeah, I mean during the launches itself. So I mean the thing I think maybe some people know but a lot of people don't know",404.15999999999997,410.24,30,Elon
82, I'm actually a chief engineer of SpaceX. So,410.32,412.32,12,Elon
83," The you know, I've signed off on pretty much all the design decisions",413.92,417.76,17,Elon
84, um and,418.40000000000003,420.24,4,Elon
85," You know, so if there's",420.24,422.24,9,Elon
86, Something that goes wrong with that,422.24,424.24,8,Elon
87," A vehicle. It's fundamentally my fault, you know, so um",424.88,428.24,16,Elon
88, So I'm really just thinking about all the things that like so so when I see the rocket,429.84000000000003,435.6,21,Elon
89, I see all the things that could go wrong and the things that could be better and the same with the,435.6,440.0,23,Elon
90, Dragon spacecraft. It's like,440.40000000000003,442.40000000000003,8,Elon
91," I'll see people see oh, this is a space craft or a rocket and that's looks really cool",442.72,446.72,23,Elon
92, I'm like,447.04,448.0,5,Elon
93, I've I've like a readout of like this is that these are the risks these are the problems. That's what I see,448.0,453.28000000000003,29,Elon
94, like,453.84000000000003,455.84000000000003,3,Elon
95, So,456.32,457.84000000000003,3,Elon
96," Not what other people see when they see the product, you know, so let me ask you then to analyze starship in that same way",457.84000000000003,463.76,30,Elon
97, I know you have you'll talk about in more detail about starship in the near future perhaps you had that,464.40000000000003,470.08,24,Elon
98, I don't know if you want but,470.32,472.24,10,Elon
99, Just in that same way like you said you see when you see up,472.24,475.52,16,Elon
100," Uh, when you see a rocket you see the sort of elicit the risks in that same way you said that starship is a really hard problem",476.48,482.32,32,Elon
101, So many ways I can ask this but,483.28000000000003,485.68,10,Elon
102, If you magically could solve one problem perfectly one engineering problem perfectly,486.48,491.12,14,Elon
103, Which one would it be on starship?,491.68,493.68,11,Elon
104, I'm sorry on starship. So is it may be related to the efficiency the,494.16,498.24,19,Elon
105, The engine the weight of the different components the complexity of various things maybe the controls of the the crazy thing as the due to land,499.2,506.16,28,Elon
106," No, it's actually the by far the the biggest thing absorbing my time is a",506.72,511.68,19,Elon
107, engine production,512.64,514.64,4,Elon
108, Not the design of the engine the I have often said prototypes are,515.04,519.6800000000001,15,Elon
109, Easy production is hard,521.04,523.04,6,Elon
110, um,523.44,525.44,3,Elon
111, So we have the most advanced rocket engine that's ever been designed um,525.44,530.5600000000001,16,Elon
112, The because I say currently the the best rocket engine ever is probably the RD 180 or RD 170,532.24,538.24,23,Elon
113, That that's the door of our engine basically um and um and still I think an engine surely count if it's gotten something to orbit,540.32,547.84,29,Elon
114, So our engine has not gotten anything to orbit yet,549.0400000000001,551.7600000000001,12,Elon
115, But it is it's the first engine that's actually,552.64,555.28,13,Elon
116, Better than then the the the Russian RD engines which are amazing design,556.64,561.84,16,Elon
117, So you're talking about Raptor engine what makes it amazing? What what are the different aspects of it that,562.64,567.68,24,Elon
118, Make it like what do you the most excited about uh if the whole thing works in terms of efficiency all those kinds of things,568.48,575.92,27,Elon
119," Well, it's",577.12,578.4,6,Elon
120, But Raptor is a a full flow,578.4,580.9599999999999,10,Elon
121, staged combustion,582.0799999999999,584.0799999999999,4,Elon
122, Engine and it's at operating at a very high chamber pressure,585.92,590.0,14,Elon
123, So one of the key figures married or perhaps the key figure of merit is,590.88,595.4399999999999,17,Elon
124, What is the chamber pressure at which the rocket engine can operate that's the combustion chamber pressure,596.9599999999999,602.16,20,Elon
125, So Raptor is,603.04,605.04,6,Elon
126, designed to operate at 300 bar possibly maybe higher the standard atmospheres so,605.12,610.56,17,Elon
127, um,612.0,613.52,3,Elon
128, The record right now for operational engine is the RD engine that I mentioned the Russian RD which is I believe run to 67,613.52,620.0,28,Elon
129, uh bar um and,620.56,622.7199999999999,6,Elon
130, The the the difficulty of the chamber pressure is increases on a non-linear basis. So,622.7199999999999,628.0799999999999,20,Elon
131, 10% more,629.04,630.24,5,Elon
132, pressure is,630.4,631.92,4,Elon
133, more like uh,631.92,633.2,5,Elon
134, 50% more difficult,633.2,635.2,6,Elon
135, um,635.92,636.88,3,Elon
136, But that that chair pressure is that that that is what allows you to get a very high,636.88,641.2,20,Elon
137, power density,642.0,643.52,4,Elon
138, for uh for the engine um so,643.52,646.48,9,Elon
139, enabling um,647.92,649.92,4,Elon
140, A very high thrust to weight ratio um and,650.32,653.52,11,Elon
141, uh a very high specific impulse,654.24,656.24,8,Elon
142, So specific impulse is like a measure of the efficiency of a rocket engine or um it's really the the the,657.04,663.84,24,Elon
143, Exhaust the effective exhaust velocity of of the gas coming out of the engine um,665.84,670.88,19,Elon
144, So uh,672.88,674.88,4,Elon
145, With with a very high chamber pressure you can have um,675.28,678.64,13,Elon
146, A a compact engine that nonetheless has a high expansion ratio which is the ratio between the uh,679.6800000000001,686.0,20,Elon
147, um,686.8,687.76,3,Elon
148, exit nozzle uh and the uh,687.76,690.96,8,Elon
149, throat so you know engines like you see your rocket engines got like sort of like about like a hour glass shape,690.96,695.92,24,Elon
150, It's like a chamber and then next down and there's a nozzle and the ratio of the the the exotimer to the,696.0,702.32,28,Elon
151, The throat uh it's an expansion ratio. So why is it such a hard engine to manufacture,703.6800000000001,708.16,21,Elon
152, a scale,708.96,710.96,4,Elon
153," Uh, it's very complex",711.2,713.2,8,Elon
154, What is complexity mean here's a lot of components involved there's a lot of a lot of components and a lot of,713.9200000000001,719.12,26,Elon
155, uh unique materials,720.1600000000001,722.1600000000001,5,Elon
156, That uh so we have to invent a,722.4000000000001,724.4000000000001,10,Elon
157, Several alloys that don't exist in order to make this engine work,725.5200000000001,729.2,16,Elon
158, um materials problem too,730.72,732.88,6,Elon
159, It's a materials problem and um it in a in a staged combustion that full flow staged combustion,734.5600000000001,740.88,21,Elon
160, There are many,741.28,742.48,5,Elon
161, feedback loops in the system so,742.48,744.48,8,Elon
162, uh,746.08,746.88,3,Elon
163, basically you've you've got,746.88,748.88,8,Elon
164, propellants and and and uh hot gas flowing,749.6,752.24,12,Elon
165, um,753.36,754.96,3,Elon
166, Simultaneously to so many different places on the engine um and,754.96,759.4399999999999,15,Elon
167, uh they all have a recursive effect on each other so you change one thing here it has a recursive effect here it changes something over there and and it's,760.16,768.24,35,Elon
168, It's it's it's quite it's hard to control um like there's a reason no one's made this before um,768.88,774.8,27,Elon
169, but um and the reason we're doing um a stage combustion,776.32,782.48,14,Elon
170, Full flow is because it has the highest of the highest of the vehicle possible uh efficiency,783.6800000000001,790.72,19,Elon
171, um so,791.76,793.04,4,Elon
172, And in in in order to make a fully reusable rocket um,794.0,798.48,14,Elon
173, Which that that's the really the holy grail of overall rocketry um,799.36,803.52,17,Elon
174, You have to have everything's got to be the best uh it's got to be the best engine the best airframe the best heat shield um,805.4399999999999,812.4,31,Elon
175, extremely light avionics,813.52,815.52,7,Elon
176, um,816.48,817.68,3,Elon
177, You know very clever control mechanisms,817.8399999999999,819.5999999999999,8,Elon
178, um you've got to shed mass in any possible way that you can um for example,820.4,825.5999999999999,19,Elon
179, We are instead of putting landing legs on the booster and ship we are going to catch them with a tower,825.5999999999999,830.0799999999999,23,Elon
180, To save the weight of the landing legs so that's like,830.7199999999999,833.8399999999999,14,Elon
181, I mean,835.04,836.3199999999999,4,Elon
182, We're talking about catching,836.3199999999999,838.3199999999999,7,Elon
183, the largest flying object ever made uh,838.3199999999999,840.3199999999999,9,Elon
184, With,842.16,843.3599999999999,3,Elon
185, On a giant tower with with trough stick arms,843.44,845.92,12,Elon
186, It's like cruddy kid with fly but much bigger,846.64,849.44,14,Elon
187, I mean pulling this probably won't work the first time,852.08,855.28,13,Elon
188," Uh and anyway, so this is bananas this is banana stuff so you mentioned that you doubt",857.28,861.28,20,Elon
189, Well not you doubt but there,861.84,863.84,8,Elon
190, There's days or moments when you doubt that this is even possible,864.48,867.6800000000001,15,Elon
191, It's so difficult,868.32,870.0,6,Elon
192, The possible part is,870.08,872.08,6,Elon
193, Well at this point,872.88,874.88,6,Elon
194, We'll I think we will we'll get starship to work um,875.0400000000001,878.24,16,Elon
195, Um,880.48,881.36,3,Elon
196, There's a question of timing how long will it take us to do this uh,881.36,885.44,18,Elon
197, How long will it take us to actually achieve uh full and rapid reusability um,885.44,889.9200000000001,18,Elon
198, Because it will take a probably many launches before we're able to have full and rapid reusability um,890.48,896.48,22,Elon
199, But I can say that that the physics,897.6,900.1600000000001,10,Elon
200, Pencils out like the like we're not uh,900.3199999999999,903.6,13,Elon
201, Like at this point. I'd say we're confident. They would that sick like let's say we're I'm very confident sick,905.6,911.28,29,Elon
202, Success is in the set of all possible outcomes,911.4399999999999,913.4399999999999,11,Elon
203, Right. It's not a set of,914.48,916.48,10,Elon
204, But for a while there I was not convinced that success was in the set of possible outcomes,916.48,920.48,20,Elon
205, So which is a very important actually but so we were um,921.52,925.36,14,Elon
206, Um,926.64,927.68,3,Elon
207, There's a chance I'm saying there's a chance exactly um,928.4799999999999,931.3599999999999,15,Elon
208," Uh, just not sure how",932.9599999999999,934.9599999999999,8,Elon
209, How long it will take uh,934.9599999999999,937.28,8,Elon
210, We have very very talented team. They're working night and day to make it happen um,938.16,942.4799999999999,20,Elon
211, and uh,943.52,945.52,4,Elon
212, Like like said that the the the the critical thing to achieve for the revolution in spaceflight and for humanity to be a space-faring civilization is to have a fully and rapidly reusable rocket over rocket,945.52,955.04,42,Elon
213," Um, there's not even been any",955.76,958.16,10,Elon
214, Over rocket that's been fully reusable ever and this has always been the,958.16,961.12,16,Elon
215, the the the the holy grail of,962.0799999999999,964.24,10,Elon
216, rocketry um and,964.24,966.24,6,Elon
217, Many smart people very smart people,967.04,969.04,8,Elon
218, Have tried to do this before and they're not succeeded. So um because it's such a hard problem,969.68,975.92,23,Elon
219, What's your source of belief in situations like this,976.9599999999999,980.48,12,Elon
220, When the engineering problem is so difficult. There's a lot of experts,981.2,984.8000000000001,16,Elon
221," Many of whom you admire who have failed in the past. Yes, and",985.6,990.4,17,Elon
222, um,991.52,992.8000000000001,3,Elon
223, A lot of people,992.8000000000001,994.96,6,Elon
224, You know the a lot of experts maybe journalists all the kind of you know the public in general have a lot of doubt about whether it's possible,994.96,1002.5600000000001,31,Elon
225, And you yourself know that even if it's a non-null set non-empty set of success,1003.6800000000001,1009.44,24,Elon
226, It's still unlikely or very difficult like where do you go to both personally,1009.5200000000001,1014.32,17,Elon
227, um intellectually as an engineer as a team,1015.2,1017.84,10,Elon
228, Like for source of strength needed to sort of persevere through this,1018.8800000000001,1022.24,15,Elon
229, And to keep going with the project take it to completion,1023.5200000000001,1026.0,13,Elon
230, you,1026.08,1028.08,3,Elon
231, S.O.S.A. strength. I just really not how I think about things um,1038.4,1042.72,22,Elon
232, I mean for me it's simply this this is something that is important to get done um and we we should just keep doing it um,1043.52,1050.24,29,Elon
233, Or die trying and I I don't need,1051.12,1054.08,11,Elon
234, S.O.S.A. strength. So quitting is not even like um,1054.96,1058.24,19,Elon
235," Yes, no it's not in my nature",1059.04,1061.04,11,Elon
236, and I don't,1061.52,1063.1999999999998,6,Elon
237, Care about optimism or pessimism,1063.1999999999998,1065.1999999999998,8,Elon
238, Fuck that we're gonna get it done gonna get it done,1066.24,1068.56,14,Elon
239, Can you then zoom back in to specific problems with starship or any engineer and problems you work on,1071.76,1077.84,22,Elon
240, Can you try to introspect your particular biological and your network your thinking process in this,1078.32,1083.9199999999998,19,Elon
241, How you think through problems through different engineering and design problems is there like a systematic process,1084.1599999999999,1090.08,19,Elon
242," You spoken about first principles thinking. Yeah, it's their kind of process to it. Well um",1090.08,1094.8,22,Elon
243, You know like saying like like physics is low and everything else is a recommendation,1097.1999999999998,1100.56,17,Elon
244," Um like I've met a lot of people looking break the law, but um having it met anyone who could break physics",1101.36,1105.4399999999998,26,Elon
245, so,1106.8,1108.8,3,Elon
246, first for you know any kind of,1108.8,1110.8,9,Elon
247, Technology problem you have just sort of just make sure you're not violating,1111.68,1116.24,16,Elon
248, physics um,1117.12,1119.12,4,Elon
249, and,1120.0,1122.0,3,Elon
250, You know uh,1122.08,1123.76,5,Elon
251, First principles analysis. I think it's something that can be applied to,1123.76,1126.1599999999999,16,Elon
252, Really any walk of life or anything really it's just it's really just saying um,1127.12,1131.84,19,Elon
253," You know, let's let's boil something down to the most fundamental",1132.72,1136.32,16,Elon
254, uh,1136.72,1137.76,3,Elon
255, Principles the things that we are most confident are true at a foundational level,1137.76,1141.9199999999998,17,Elon
256, And that sets your at your sets your axiomatic base and then you reason up from there,1142.48,1146.48,21,Elon
257, And then you cross check your conclusion against the the axiomatic truth,1146.96,1151.04,16,Elon
258, um,1152.56,1153.76,3,Elon
259, so,1153.76,1155.76,3,Elon
260," Um, you know some basics and physics would be like are you violating conservation of energy or momentum or something like that",1155.84,1161.04,25,Elon
261, You know then you just it's not gonna work,1161.12,1163.6,12,Elon
262, um,1163.84,1165.84,3,Elon
263, so,1165.84,1167.84,3,Elon
264," Uh, that's",1167.9199999999998,1169.12,6,Elon
265," You know, so that's just to establish is it is it possible",1169.12,1171.9199999999998,16,Elon
266, And then another good physics tool is thinking about things in the limit if you if you take a particular thing and you,1172.9599999999998,1178.7199999999998,25,Elon
267," Uh, scale it to a very large number or to a very small number how does how does things change",1179.52,1184.56,23,Elon
268," um, well it's like temper like in a number of things you manufacture something like that and then in time",1185.28,1190.7199999999998,24,Elon
269," Yeah, like let's say it takes an example of like um",1191.68,1194.16,15,Elon
270, Like manufacturing which I think is just a very underrated problem um and and,1195.1200000000001,1201.04,17,Elon
271," Uh, likes it it's much harder to",1202.24,1204.8,11,Elon
272, Take a advanced technology product and bring it into volume manufacturing that it is to design it in the first place my orders magnitude so,1206.8,1214.72,27,Elon
273," Um, so let's say you're trying to figure out is",1215.76,1218.16,15,Elon
274," um, like why is this",1218.96,1220.96,8,Elon
275," This uh, part or product expensive is it um",1220.96,1224.8000000000002,12,Elon
276, Because of something fundamentally foolish that we're doing or is it because our volume is too low,1225.68,1230.8000000000002,20,Elon
277," And so they say okay, well, what if our volume was a million years a year is it still expensive?",1231.28,1235.1200000000001,25,Elon
278," That's what I mean, but I think about things to the limit",1235.68,1237.52,16,Elon
279, If it's still expensive at a million units a year then volume is not the reason why you think it's expensive,1238.0800000000002,1242.16,25,Elon
280, There's something fundamental about design,1242.48,1243.8400000000001,8,Elon
281, And then you then can focus on the,1244.72,1246.3999999999999,10,Elon
282, Reducing complexity or something like that in the design to change change the part to be something that is uh,1246.3999999999999,1252.0,24,Elon
283, Uh,1253.12,1254.24,3,Elon
284, Not fundamentally expensive,1254.24,1256.24,5,Elon
285, But it like that's a common thing in rock tree because the the,1256.3999999999999,1259.76,16,Elon
286, Uniflying is as relatively low,1259.84,1261.76,9,Elon
287," And so a common excuse would be well, it's expensive because our uniform is low",1261.76,1265.9199999999998,19,Elon
288," Um, and if we were in like automotive or something like that or consumer electronics then our cost would be lower",1266.48,1270.8799999999999,24,Elon
289," I'm like okay, so let's say we skate now you're making a million units a year. Is this the most expensive?",1270.96,1275.5200000000002,29,Elon
290, The answer is yes,1276.0800000000002,1277.68,6,Elon
291, then,1277.68,1279.68,3,Elon
292, Economy's a scale and not the issue,1279.7600000000002,1281.7600000000002,10,Elon
293, Do you throw into manufacturing do you throw like supply chain,1282.0800000000002,1285.3600000000001,13,Elon
294, Talk about resources and materials and stuff like that do you throw that into the calculation of trying to reason from first,1286.0,1291.2800000000002,24,Elon
295, Principles like how we're gonna make the supply chain work here,1291.2800000000002,1293.68,15,Elon
296," Yeah, yeah, and then the cost of materials things like that or is that too much exactly so um like",1294.5600000000002,1300.48,24,Elon
297, And another like a good example like of thinking about things in the limit is um if you take any,1300.64,1306.56,22,Elon
298, Uh,1307.04,1309.04,3,Elon
299, You know any any,1309.04,1311.04,6,Elon
300, Product eight machine or whatever um,1311.04,1313.28,8,Elon
301, Like take a rocket or whatever and say,1314.32,1316.48,10,Elon
302, Um if you've got if if you look at the room if you're raw materials in the rocket um,1318.08,1323.04,23,Elon
303, So you're gonna have like a,1323.6,1325.6,9,Elon
304, I don't know aluminum steel titanium in canal,1325.6,1328.08,11,Elon
305," Uh, especially speciality alloys",1329.04,1331.04,9,Elon
306, um,1331.6799999999998,1332.6399999999999,3,Elon
307, Copper and and you say what are the how,1332.6399999999999,1335.9199999999998,11,Elon
308, What what's the weight of the constituent elements of each of these elements and what is their raw material value,1336.72,1341.84,24,Elon
309, and that sets the,1342.6399999999999,1344.6399999999999,6,Elon
310, Asmetic limit for how,1344.6399999999999,1346.6399999999999,8,Elon
311," Uh, lower the cost of the vehicle can be unless you change the materials",1347.9199999999998,1350.96,17,Elon
312, So and then when you do that I call it like maybe the magic one number or something like that,1351.84,1356.48,22,Elon
313, So that would be like if you had the,1356.56,1358.4,11,Elon
314," You know a like just a pile of these raw materials. Yeah, you could wave the magic wand and rearrange the atoms into the final shape",1359.28,1365.3600000000001,30,Elon
315, um,1366.08,1367.04,3,Elon
316, That would be the lowest possible cost that you could make this thing for unless you change the materials,1367.04,1371.92,21,Elon
317, So then and that is always a use almost always a very low number um,1372.72,1377.04,17,Elon
318, So then the the what's actually causing these to be expensive is how you put the atoms into the desired shape,1377.76,1383.84,24,Elon
319, You,1383.9199999999998,1385.9199999999998,3,Elon
320," Yeah, actually if you're mind me taking a tiny tangent had uh, I often talk to Jim Keller who's something to work with you",1385.9199999999998,1393.28,30,Elon
321," Oh, yeah, Jim was uh, yeah, great work at Tesla",1393.28,1397.12,16,Elon
322," So um, I suppose he carries the flame of the same kind of thinking that you're you're talking about now",1397.76,1404.24,25,Elon
323," um, and I guess I see that same thing at Tesla and",1405.4399999999998,1408.72,15,Elon
324," And uh, SpaceX folks who worked there they kind of learned this way of thinking and it kind of becomes obvious almost",1409.52,1416.08,25,Elon
325," But anyway, I had um argument not argument",1416.72,1419.52,11,Elon
326," Uh, he educated me",1420.64,1422.64,7,Elon
327, about how cheap it might be to manufacture a Tesla bot,1422.72,1426.4,13,Elon
328, We just we had an argument what is how can you reduce the cost of scale of producing a robot because,1426.64,1432.48,23,Elon
329, So I got in the chance to interact quite a bit,1432.8,1435.28,13,Elon
330, Obviously in in the academic circles with human robots and then my boss and dynamics and stuff like that,1436.0,1441.52,21,Elon
331," And then they're very expensive to build um, and then",1441.92,1444.8799999999999,14,Elon
332," Uh, Jim kind of schooled me on saying like okay, like this kind of first principles thinking of how can we get the cost of manufacturing?",1445.84,1451.84,32,Elon
333," um, I suppose you do that you have done uh, that kind of thinking for Tesla bot and for all kinds of",1452.72,1458.72,26,Elon
334, All kinds of complex systems that are traditionally seen as complex and you say okay,1460.08,1464.32,17,Elon
335, How can we simplify everything now?,1464.3999999999999,1466.3999999999999,9,Elon
336," Yeah, I mean I think if you if you are really good at manufacturing",1467.28,1471.12,17,Elon
337, You can basically,1472.3999999999999,1474.3999999999999,5,Elon
338, Make at high volume you can basically make anything for a cost,1474.3999999999999,1477.36,14,Elon
339, That asymptotically approaches is the role of raw material value of the constituents plus any intellectual property that you need to do license,1478.56,1485.52,27,Elon
340, Anything right,1486.56,1488.56,4,Elon
341, But it's it's hard. It's not like that's a very hard thing to do but but it is possible for anything,1489.36,1494.1599999999999,28,Elon
342, Anything in volume can be made of like I said for a cost,1494.72,1498.56,15,Elon
343, That asymptotically approaches is raw material constituents,1499.2,1502.1599999999999,11,Elon
344, plus intellectual property license rights,1502.72,1504.72,7,Elon
345, So what will often happen in trying to design a product is people start with the tools and and parts and methods that they're familiar with,1505.36,1513.36,29,Elon
346," um, and then and try to create the product using their existing tools and methods",1514.24,1519.36,18,Elon
347," um, the other way to think about it is",1520.24,1522.4799999999998,12,Elon
348," Uh, actually imagine the try to imagine the platonic ideal of the perfect",1523.4399999999998,1527.52,17,Elon
349, product or technology whatever it might be,1528.0,1530.1599999999999,9,Elon
350," um, and say what is this what what is the perfect arrangement of atoms?",1531.04,1534.8,18,Elon
351, That would be the the best possible product,1535.6799999999998,1537.52,10,Elon
352, And now let us try to figure out how to get the atoms in that shape,1538.56,1541.12,18,Elon
353, I mean it's it sounds um,1543.9199999999998,1545.9199999999998,9,Elon
354, And it's almost like a rica mordie absurd until you start to really think about it and it you really should,1547.52,1553.6799999999998,26,Elon
355, Think about it in this way because everything else is kind of uh if you if you think uh,1554.8,1560.08,21,Elon
356, You you might fall victim to the momentum of the way things are done in the past unless you think in this way,1561.1999999999998,1565.52,25,Elon
357," Well, just as a function of inertia people will want to use the same tools and methods that they're familiar with",1566.0,1571.52,25,Elon
358, um,1572.1599999999999,1573.12,3,Elon
359, They just that's what they'll do by default,1573.36,1575.36,12,Elon
360," Um, and then that that will lead to an outcome of things that can be made with those tools and methods",1575.36,1580.3999999999999,24,Elon
361, But it is unlikely to be the um platonic ideal of the perfect product um,1580.56,1585.4399999999998,18,Elon
362, So then so that's why it's it's good to think of things in both directions,1586.08,1590.08,20,Elon
363, They're like what can we build with the tools that we have but then but but also what is the what is the perfect the theoretical,1590.08,1596.24,29,Elon
364, Perfect product look like and and that that theoretical perfect product is going to be a moving target because the as you learn more,1596.24,1602.08,26,Elon
365, The definition of or for that perfect product will will change because you don't actually know what the perfect product is,1602.72,1608.72,24,Elon
366, But you can successfully approximate a a more perfect product,1608.72,1612.8799999999999,12,Elon
367," um, so think about it like that and then saying okay now what tools methods materials whatever do we need to",1613.52,1620.56,24,Elon
368, Create in order to get the atoms in that shape,1621.6799999999998,1624.48,12,Elon
369, But for people very rarely think about it that way,1626.0,1629.1999999999998,12,Elon
370, But it's a powerful tool,1630.0800000000002,1632.0800000000002,8,Elon
371, I should mention that the brilliant shavon zillis is hanging,1632.64,1636.16,16,Elon
372, hanging out with us,1637.1200000000001,1638.8,6,Elon
373, In case you hear a voice of wisdom from uh from from from outside from up above,1638.8,1643.8400000000001,19,Elon
374," Okay, so let me ask you about Mars you mentioned it would be great for science to put",1645.68,1650.8,21,Elon
375, um a base on the moon to do some research but,1651.8400000000001,1655.2,13,Elon
376, The truly big leap again in this category of seemingly impossible is to put a human being on Mars,1655.6000000000001,1662.96,21,Elon
377, When do you think spaceux will land a human being on Mars?,1663.76,1666.56,16,Elon
378, The best case is about five years worst case tenures,1685.8400000000001,1692.4,13,Elon
379, What are the determining factors would you say from an engineering perspective or is that that not the bottlenecks?,1696.88,1702.72,23,Elon
380, I know it's it's fundamentally um,1704.0,1706.0,10,Elon
381, You're engineering the the vehicle um,1707.04,1709.28,9,Elon
382, um,1709.44,1710.6399999999999,3,Elon
383, I mean starship is the most,1712.3999999999999,1714.3999999999999,9,Elon
384, Complex in advanced rocket that's ever been made by,1715.2,1717.52,12,Elon
385, I don't know what if I get to hear something like that. It's a lot. It's really next level so,1718.8799999999999,1723.28,27,Elon
386, um and the fundamental optimization of,1725.2,1728.08,8,Elon
387, Starship is minimizing cost pretend to overt and ultimately cost pretend to surface of Mars,1728.72,1733.6,18,Elon
388," Um, this may seem like a mogen tile objective, but it is actually the thing that needs to be optimized",1734.56,1739.12,25,Elon
389, Like there is a certain,1740.24,1742.24,7,Elon
390, Cost pretend to the surface of Mars where we can afford to establish a self-sustaining city,1742.24,1747.76,22,Elon
391, Um and then and then above that we cannot afford to do it um,1748.56,1752.8799999999999,16,Elon
392, So right right now you couldn't fly to Mars for trillion dollars doesn't know amount of money could get your ticket to Mars,1752.8799999999999,1758.56,27,Elon
393, So we need to get that above,1759.1999999999998,1761.28,9,Elon
394, You know to get that like something that is actually possible at all um,1762.16,1765.6,16,Elon
395," Um, but but then but that's thus",1766.8799999999999,1768.96,11,Elon
396, We don't we don't just want to have you know with Mars flags and footprints and then not come back for a half century like we did with the moon,1769.92,1776.72,34,Elon
397, uh in in order to,1777.44,1779.44,7,Elon
398, Pass a very important to great filter. I think we need to be a multi-planet species um,1780.48,1786.56,23,Elon
399," Let's make sound somewhat esoteric to to a lot of people, but uh",1787.28,1791.6,19,Elon
400," Yeah, give eventually given enough time",1793.36,1795.36,9,Elon
401, uh,1796.32,1797.28,3,Elon
402, This is something the earth is likely to experience some calamity um that could be,1797.28,1802.72,18,Elon
403," Yeah, something that humans do to themselves or an external event like happen to the dinosaurs um and",1804.0,1811.36,21,Elon
404, um but a bit of you know eventually,1812.08,1814.1599999999999,10,Elon
405, And any if if not none if if none of that happens and somehow magically we we keep going,1814.96,1820.5600000000002,21,Elon
406," Uh, then the sun will ex the sun is gradually expanding um and will engulf the earth um and",1821.1200000000001,1826.88,23,Elon
407, probably earth gets too hot for,1827.52,1829.52,8,Elon
408, uh life in,1830.4,1832.4,5,Elon
409, Uh,1832.4,1833.6000000000001,3,Elon
410," About 500 million years it's a long time, but that's only 10% longer than earth has been around",1833.6000000000001,1838.24,24,Elon
411, and so if you think about like the,1839.3600000000001,1841.3600000000001,10,Elon
412, Because the current situation is really remarkable um and kind of hard to believe but,1842.24,1845.84,17,Elon
413," Uh, it's been around four and a half billion years and this is the first time if one half billion years that it's been possible to extend life beyond earth",1847.52,1854.1599999999999,35,Elon
414, And that window of opportunity may be open for a long time and I hope it is but it also may be open for a short time,1855.76,1861.1999999999998,29,Elon
415," and we should uh, I think it was",1861.76,1863.76,11,Elon
416, wise for us to,1864.56,1866.56,6,Elon
417, uh,1866.56,1868.56,3,Elon
418, Act quickly while the video is open just in case it closes,1868.56,1872.8799999999999,14,Elon
419," Yeah, the existence of nuclear weapons pandemics",1873.76,1876.8799999999999,11,Elon
420," All kinds of threats. Yeah, should uh, should kind of um give us some motivation",1877.84,1883.6799999999998,20,Elon
421, I mean civilization could get um,1885.04,1887.6,8,Elon
422, Could die with a bang or a whimper you know if it's uh,1888.8,1892.08,17,Elon
423, If it dies of demographic it collapse then it's more of a whimper obviously,1892.96,1897.12,18,Elon
424," Uh, but it and if it's world war three is more of a bang",1898.0,1899.9199999999998,18,Elon
425," But but these are all risks um, I mean it's important to think of these things and just",1900.6399999999999,1904.8,22,Elon
426," You know things things as like probabilities not certainties um, there's no probability that",1905.4399999999998,1910.1599999999999,19,Elon
427, Something about will happen on earth. I like I think most likely the future will be good um,1910.8799999999999,1915.84,21,Elon
428, But there's like let's say for arguments sake um a 1% chance per century of,1916.4799999999998,1921.4399999999998,20,Elon
429, Of a civilization ending event like that was Stephen Hawking's estimate,1922.1599999999999,1925.4399999999998,15,Elon
430," Um, I think he's he might be right about that uh, so then",1926.4,1932.0,18,Elon
431, uh,1933.1200000000001,1935.1200000000001,3,Elon
432," You know, we should basically",1935.28,1937.52,8,Elon
433, Think of this like being a multi-plant species is like taking out insurance for life itself like life insurance for life,1937.52,1943.04,25,Elon
434, So turn into an informal real quick life insurance for life. Yes,1946.56,1950.3200000000002,15,Elon
435," Um, and you know we can bring the the the creatures from you know plants animals from earth",1951.28,1957.28,21,Elon
436, Tomorrow's and breathe life into the planet,1957.4399999999998,1959.28,10,Elon
437, um and and have a second planet with with life um,1960.1599999999999,1963.84,13,Elon
438," That would be great um, they can't bring themselves there, you know",1964.56,1967.52,17,Elon
439, So if we don't bring them to Mars then they will just,1967.52,1970.6399999999999,15,Elon
440," For sure, or die when the sun expands anyway and then that'll be it",1971.36,1975.52,18,Elon
441, What do you think is the most difficult aspect of building a civilization on Mars?,1976.08,1980.6399999999999,18,Elon
442, Terraforming Mars like from a generic perspective from a financial perspective,1980.96,1985.12,14,Elon
443, human perspective to get,1985.76,1987.76,6,Elon
444, To get a large number of folks there who will never return back to earth,1989.92,1994.96,17,Elon
445," Uh, no, I think it's what need return some will return back to earth. They will choose to stay there for the rest of their lives",1995.6,2000.96,32,Elon
446," Yeah, many will um",2001.2,2003.2,7,Elon
447," But uh, you know, we",2003.76,2005.76,9,Elon
448, The we need the spaceships back like the ones that go to Mars freedom back,2006.96,2009.92,18,Elon
449," So you're gonna hop on if you want, you know, I think it's like but we can't just you know how the spaces come back",2010.0,2014.64,32,Elon
450, The those things are expensive we need them back like to come back and turn the trip,2014.88,2018.48,19,Elon
451," I mean, do you think about the terraforming aspect like actually building are you still focused right now on the spaceships part that's so critical",2018.72,2025.2,31,Elon
452," Yeah, yeah, this is we absolutely if you can't get there nothing else matters",2025.44,2028.88,19,Elon
453, So and like said you you can't get there with,2029.68,2032.4,13,Elon
454," At some extraordinarily high cost I mean the current cost of um, let's say one ton to the surface of Mars is on the order of a billion dollars",2033.1200000000001,2041.44,33,Elon
455, So because you don't just need the rocket and the launch and everything you need like heat shield you need you know,2042.72,2047.76,25,Elon
456, guidance system you need deep space communications. You need some kind of landing system,2048.7200000000003,2054.1600000000003,17,Elon
457, So like rough approximation would be,2055.04,2057.2000000000003,8,Elon
458," Uh, a billion dollars per ton to the surface of Mars right now",2058.08,2061.2000000000003,16,Elon
459, This is obviously,2062.16,2064.16,5,Elon
460, Way too expensive to create a self-sustaining civilization,2066.0,2068.8799999999997,14,Elon
461," um, so we need to improve that by",2069.6,2072.16,11,Elon
462, At least a factor of a thousand a million per ton,2074.16,2077.7599999999998,13,Elon
463," Yes, ideally less that much less than a million ton, but if it's not",2078.48,2081.52,19,Elon
464, Like it's got to be,2082.56,2084.24,8,Elon
465, You say like what well how much can society afford to spend or want to just want to spend on a self-sustaining,2084.24,2090.48,28,Elon
466, City on Mars the self-sustaining part is important like it's just the key threshold,2091.04,2096.0,21,Elon
467," um, the great filter will have been passed",2097.12,2100.4,11,Elon
468, When the city on Mars,2101.44,2103.44,7,Elon
469, It can survive even if the space shifts from earth stop coming for any reason,2104.32,2108.48,17,Elon
470, Doesn't matter what the reason is but if they stop coming for any reason will it die out or will it not and if there's even one,2109.04,2114.72,31,Elon
471, Critical ingredient missing then,2115.12,2117.12,6,Elon
472, It still doesn't count. It's like,2117.2799999999997,2119.2799999999997,11,Elon
473, You know if you're a long sea voyage and you've got everything except vitamin C,2119.2799999999997,2121.92,19,Elon
474," It's only a matter of time, you know, you're gonna die",2123.8399999999997,2125.8399999999997,17,Elon
475, So so we're gonna get Mars a Mars city to the point where it's self-sustaining,2126.3199999999997,2130.64,23,Elon
476," Um, I'm not sure this will really happen in my lifetime, but I I hope to see it at least have a lot of momentum",2131.52,2136.4,30,Elon
477, And and then you could say like what is the minimum tonnage necessary to uh have a self-sustaining city,2137.2799999999997,2142.88,27,Elon
478, um,2144.0,2145.2,3,Elon
479, And there's a lot of uncertainty about this you can say like I don't know,2145.2799999999997,2147.9199999999996,19,Elon
480, It's probably at least a million tons,2148.48,2150.48,10,Elon
481, um,2150.96,2152.0,3,Elon
482, Because you have to set up a lot of infrastructure on on Mars um like I said you can't be missing any,2152.0,2157.12,25,Elon
483, anything that,2158.08,2160.0,4,Elon
484, In order for self-sustaining you can't be missing like you need you know a semiconductor,2160.0,2163.3599999999997,22,Elon
485, fabs you need,2164.08,2165.9199999999996,6,Elon
486," iron ore refineries you like you need all lots of things, you know, uh, so",2165.9199999999996,2169.6,22,Elon
487," Um, and Mars is not super hospitable",2170.8799999999997,2173.52,11,Elon
488," It's the least inhospitable planet, but it's definitely a fixer operapha planet",2173.68,2177.68,22,Elon
489, That's out of earth,2178.08,2179.44,7,Elon
490," Yes, earth is pretty good. It's like easy",2179.44,2181.52,13,Elon
491," Yeah, and also I should we should clarify it in the solar system. Yes, in the solar system",2182.16,2186.64,23,Elon
492, There might be nice,2186.64,2188.08,6,Elon
493, Like vacation spots,2188.08,2189.7599999999998,5,Elon
494," There might be some great planets out there, but it's hopeless to get there. Yeah, way way way way too hard",2189.7599999999998,2195.52,27,Elon
495, To say the least let me push back on that not really a pushback but a quick curve ball of a question,2196.56,2201.6,25,Elon
496, So you did mention physics as the the first starting point so um,2201.92,2206.08,15,Elon
497, General relativity allows for warm holes,2208.0,2210.24,8,Elon
498, They technically can exist. Do you think um those can ever be leveraged by humans to travel fast in this be a light,2211.2,2217.52,27,Elon
499, Well,2219.44,2221.44,3,Elon
500, Are you saying that? The whole thing is is debatable the,2221.44,2224.08,15,Elon
501, That we currently do not know of any means of going fast in the speed of light,2225.92,2229.6,19,Elon
502, Um,2230.24,2231.7599999999998,3,Elon
503, There there is like,2231.7599999999998,2233.7599999999998,6,Elon
504, Like,2234.96,2236.96,3,Elon
505, There are some ideas about,2237.44,2239.44,7,Elon
506, having space like so so,2240.16,2242.16,7,Elon
507," You're gonna let move at the speed of light through through space, but",2245.2,2247.52,17,Elon
508, If you can make space itself move,2248.64,2250.64,9,Elon
509, That that that's like that that's a real warming space,2251.6,2254.24,14,Elon
510, If um space is capable of moving faster than the speed of light,2255.2,2258.72,15,Elon
511, Right uh like the universe in the big bang the universe the universe expanded it much much more than the speed of light,2259.6,2265.36,25,Elon
512, by a lot yeah,2266.0,2268.0,6,Elon
513, so,2268.88,2270.4,3,Elon
514, um,2270.4,2271.7599999999998,3,Elon
515, But the,2271.7599999999998,2273.7599999999998,4,Elon
516, If this is possible the the amount of energy required to wolf space is so,2275.04,2279.12,17,Elon
517, Gigantic it's boggles the mind,2280.56,2282.56,11,Elon
518, So all the work you've done with propulsion how much innovation is possible with rocket propulsion is this um,2283.12,2288.7999999999997,22,Elon
519, I mean you've seen it all and you're constantly innovating in every aspect,2289.68,2293.2,18,Elon
520, How much is possible like how much can you get 10x somehow is there something in there in physics,2294.4,2298.96,22,Elon
521, That you can get significant improvement in terms of efficiency of engines and all those kinds of things,2299.6,2303.52,20,Elon
522, Well as I was saying like the really the holy grail is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital system um,2304.64,2312.24,23,Elon
523, so,2313.04,2314.24,3,Elon
524, uh right now uh,2314.24,2316.24,6,Elon
525, The,2316.3999999999996,2317.4399999999996,3,Elon
526, Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out there,2317.4399999999996,2320.72,11,Elon
527, but but the the booster comes back in lands. I'm sure you've seen the videos,2321.2799999999997,2325.3599999999997,20,Elon
528, Uh and we get the nose cono fairing back but we do not get the upper stage back,2325.8399999999997,2329.12,22,Elon
529, so,2329.8399999999997,2331.8399999999997,3,Elon
530, That means that we have a minimum cost of,2332.56,2334.3999999999996,11,Elon
531, Building an upper stage um,2335.4399999999996,2337.4399999999996,7,Elon
532, You can think of like a two stage rocket of sort of like two airplanes like a big airplane and a small airplane,2337.6,2342.4799999999996,25,Elon
533, And we get bigger plane back with another small airplane,2343.44,2345.84,12,Elon
534," And so it's still cost a lot you know, so that upper stage is",2345.84,2349.6,18,Elon
535, You know at least 10 million dollars,2350.32,2352.32,9,Elon
536, um and then the,2352.32,2354.72,6,Elon
537, Degree of the the booster is not as reuse it is not as rapidly and completely reusable as we'd like in order the fairings,2354.72,2360.4,29,Elon
538, So you know our kind of,2360.96,2362.72,8,Elon
539, Minimum marginal cost not counting overhead for per flight is on the order of,2363.44,2368.32,18,Elon
540, 15,2369.52,2371.04,3,Elon
541, 20 million dollars maybe um so,2371.12,2373.6,8,Elon
542, That's that's extremely good for it's by far better than any rocket ever in history um,2375.68,2380.64,21,Elon
543, but,2381.68,2382.88,3,Elon
544, uh,2382.88,2383.68,3,Elon
545, With full and rapid reusability we can,2383.68,2385.68,10,Elon
546, Reduce the cost per ton to orbit by,2386.72,2389.04,11,Elon
547, Uh a factor of a hundred,2390.0,2392.0,8,Elon
548, But just think of it like um,2393.04,2395.04,9,Elon
549, Like imagine if you had an aircraft or something or a car,2395.36,2398.48,14,Elon
550," Oh yeah, and if you had to buy a new car every time you went for a drive",2399.28,2404.48,21,Elon
551, There'll be very expensive,2405.04,2406.72,7,Elon
552," Every silly frankly, but um",2406.72,2409.04,8,Elon
553, But you in fact you just refuel the car or recharge the car,2409.92,2412.72,16,Elon
554, And that's uh makes your trip,2413.52,2415.52,9,Elon
555, Like,2417.2,2418.48,3,Elon
556, I don't know a thousand times cheaper,2418.48,2420.48,10,Elon
557, So,2420.48,2421.92,3,Elon
558, It's the same for rockets uh if you,2421.92,2423.92,11,Elon
559, So it's very difficult to make this complex machine that can go to orbit,2424.88,2428.0,17,Elon
560, And so if you cannot reuse it and have to have to throw even any part of any significant part of it away that massively increases the cost,2428.64,2435.84,30,Elon
561, so,2436.7200000000003,2438.7200000000003,3,Elon
562, You know Starship and theory could do,2438.96,2440.96,10,Elon
563, A cost per launch of like a million maybe two million dollars or something like that um,2441.84,2447.2000000000003,19,Elon
564, And uh and put over a hundred tons in orbit,2448.4,2451.36,12,Elon
565," This is crazy. Yeah, so that's incredible. So you're saying like it's uh by far the biggest bang for the block is to make the fully reusable versus like",2452.32,2461.36,37,Elon
566, some kind of,2461.84,2462.96,5,Elon
567," Brilliant breakthrough into your ethical physics. Yeah, no, there's no there's no brilliant breaking up. There's no",2462.96,2468.48,26,Elon
568, It just meant you were gonna make the rocket reusable. This is this is an extremely difficult entering problem,2469.2000000000003,2472.88,22,Elon
569," Got it. Uh, but no new physics is required",2473.52,2475.52,13,Elon
570, I,2476.0,2478.0,3,Elon
571, Just brilliant engineering. Let me ask a slightly philosophical fun question,2478.0,2481.84,14,Elon
572," Gotta ask I know you're focused on getting to Mars, but once we're there on Mars. What do you what form of government?",2482.16,2488.32,30,Elon
573, economic system,2488.72,2490.72,4,Elon
574, Political system do you think would work best for an early civilization of humans?,2490.88,2496.24,17,Elon
575, Is do you I mean the interesting reason to talk about the stuff?,2497.2,2501.44,16,Elon
576, It also may helps people dream about the future. I know you're really focused about,2501.52,2505.84,19,Elon
577," The short term engineering dream, but it's like I don't know",2506.48,2509.36,16,Elon
578, There's something about imagining an actual civilization of Mars that gives people,2509.36,2513.04,15,Elon
579, So it really gives people hope well,2513.84,2515.68,9,Elon
580, It would be a new frontier and an opportunity to rethink the whole natural government,2515.76,2519.36,17,Elon
581, Just as was done in the creation of the United States,2519.6,2521.92,13,Elon
582, so uh,2522.7200000000003,2524.7200000000003,4,Elon
583," I mean, I would suggest um",2527.36,2529.36,9,Elon
584, having uh,2530.32,2532.32,4,Elon
585, Direct democracy like people vote directly on things as opposed to representative democracy. So,2533.1200000000003,2538.7200000000003,17,Elon
586, Uh representative democracy. I think is to uh subject to special interest and,2539.76,2545.36,16,Elon
587, You know a coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing um,2546.48,2550.32,16,Elon
588, So I'd recommend,2551.36,2553.36,6,Elon
589, That that those just,2555.36,2557.36,6,Elon
590, um,2558.32,2558.6400000000003,3,Elon
591, Direct democracy people vote on laws the population votes on laws themselves,2558.6400000000003,2562.1600000000003,14,Elon
592, And then the laws must be short enough that people can understand them,2562.6400000000003,2565.6,15,Elon
593," Yeah, and then like keeping a well-informed populist like really being transparent about all the information",2566.88,2572.1600000000003,23,Elon
594, But what they're voting for absolute transparency. Yeah,2572.2400000000002,2575.04,12,Elon
595, And not make it as annoying as those cookies we have to accept the,2575.52,2578.7200000000003,16,Elon
596, Accept cookies I go always like,2578.88,2580.7200000000003,8,Elon
597," You know, it's like always like a slight amount of trepidation when you click accept cookies like",2581.52,2585.6,24,Elon
598, Like feel as though there's like perhaps like a like a very tiny chance that'll open a portal to hell or something like that,2585.92,2591.44,28,Elon
599, Exactly,2592.3199999999997,2594.3199999999997,3,Elon
600, Why do they what why do they keep it? Why do you accept the what do they want with this cookie?,2594.3199999999997,2597.68,25,Elon
601, I like somebody got upset with accepting cookies or something somewhere,2598.7999999999997,2601.8399999999997,13,Elon
602, I mean who cares like,2602.16,2604.16,7,Elon
603, So annoying to keep keep accepting all these cookies me,2604.24,2607.2,12,Elon
604," This is just a great extent. Yes, you can have my damn cookie. I don't care. Whatever",2607.6,2611.6,24,Elon
605, He heard it from me on first he accepts all your damn cookies. Yeah,2612.3199999999997,2616.24,17,Elon
606, It's all asking me,2617.92,2619.92,7,Elon
607, annoying,2620.24,2621.44,3,Elon
608," Yeah, it's a one example of",2621.44,2623.68,10,Elon
609, implementation of a good idea done,2625.2799999999997,2627.6,8,Elon
610," Really horribly yeah, it's somebody who was like there's some good intentions of like",2629.2,2632.88,19,Elon
611," Privacy or whatever, but now everyone's just has to take accept cookies and it's now you know",2634.0,2638.56,23,Elon
612, You have billions of people who have to keep clicking accept cookie and super annoying,2638.64,2641.44,17,Elon
613, Then we just just accept the damn cookie. It's fine. There is like um,2642.4,2646.08,19,Elon
614, I think a fundamental problem that we're because we've not really had a major,2646.96,2650.88,18,Elon
615, Like a world war or something like that in a while and obviously we would would like to not have hold was,2652.24,2656.56,24,Elon
616, um,2656.88,2657.92,3,Elon
617, There's not been a cleansing function for rules and regulations,2657.92,2661.2,13,Elon
618, um,2661.7599999999998,2662.72,3,Elon
619, So wars did have,2662.72,2664.72,6,Elon
620, Some sort of lining in that there would be a,2664.9599999999996,2667.3599999999997,12,Elon
621, A reset on rules and regulations after a war. So all those one and two there were huge resets on rules and regulations,2667.8399999999997,2674.24,27,Elon
622, um,2674.72,2675.7599999999998,3,Elon
623, Now as if the society society does not have a war that and there's no cleansing function or garbage collection for rules and regulations,2675.7599999999998,2682.7999999999997,27,Elon
624, Then rules and regulations will accumulate every year because they're immortal. There's no actual,2682.7999999999997,2687.2799999999997,19,Elon
625," humans die, but the lowest owned",2687.9199999999996,2689.9199999999996,9,Elon
626, so,2690.3999999999996,2691.4399999999996,3,Elon
627, The we need a garbage collection function for rules and regulations that should not just be immortal,2691.44,2696.56,19,Elon
628, um,2697.04,2697.52,3,Elon
629, Because some of the rules and regulations that are put in place will be counterproductive,2697.52,2701.2000000000003,19,Elon
630," Uh done with good intentions, but counterproductive sometimes not done with good intentions. So",2701.6,2705.84,20,Elon
631," Um, if you just if rules and regulations is to accumulate every year um and get more and more of them",2707.12,2711.84,24,Elon
632, Then eventually you won't be able to do anything,2712.32,2714.8,12,Elon
633, You're just like golevard with you know tie down by thousands of little strings,2714.8,2718.88,19,Elon
634," and we hit we see that in um, you know",2719.6,2722.8,13,Elon
635, US and like basically all all economies that have been around for for a while,2724.32,2730.0,17,Elon
636, uh and and regulators and legislators,2730.7200000000003,2733.92,8,Elon
637," Create new rules and regulations every year, but they don't put effort into removing them",2734.48,2738.48,19,Elon
638, And I think that's very important that we put effort into removing rules and regulations,2738.7200000000003,2741.52,18,Elon
639, um,2742.48,2743.92,3,Elon
640, But it gets tough because you get special interests that then are dependent on like they they have a,2743.92,2748.08,21,Elon
641," You know, uh",2748.56,2749.84,6,Elon
642, Invested interest in that whatever rule and regulation and that they then they fight,2749.84,2753.2,17,Elon
643, To not get it removed,2754.0,2756.0,7,Elon
644, um,2756.3199999999997,2757.52,3,Elon
645," Yeah, so it i mean i guess the problem with the constitution is it's it's kind of like c",2757.52,2762.4,24,Elon
646, versus java because it doesn't have any garbage collection built in,2763.12,2766.64,15,Elon
647, I think there should be a i when you first said that the the metaphor of garbage collection,2766.72,2770.7999999999997,20,Elon
648," coding set point for the coding standpoint. Yeah, yeah",2771.2799999999997,2773.52,13,Elon
649, I it would be interesting interesting is the laws themselves kind of had a built-in,2773.92,2777.84,19,Elon
650, Thing where they kind of die after a while and somebody explicitly publicly defend them,2778.64,2783.2,17,Elon
651," Yeah, so that that's sort of it's not like somebody has to kill them. They kind of die themselves",2783.6,2787.36,25,Elon
652, They disappear. Yeah,2788.08,2790.08,6,Elon
653, um,2790.08,2791.6,3,Elon
654," Not the defend java or anything, but you know the c++, you know, you could also have great garbage collection and python and so on",2792.48,2799.36,32,Elon
655," Yeah, so yeah, something's got something needs to happen or or just thought the",2799.92,2805.2799999999997,19,Elon
656, Civilizations arteries arteries just harden over time,2805.28,2807.76,10,Elon
657, and and you can just get less and less done because there's just a rule against everything,2808.6400000000003,2812.96,20,Elon
658, so,2814.88,2816.32,3,Elon
659, So i think like i don't know for miles or whatever i'd say oh even for you,2816.32,2819.36,21,Elon
660, Obviously for earth as well like i think there should be an active,2819.36,2821.6800000000003,15,Elon
661, process for removing,2822.1600000000003,2824.0,5,Elon
662, rules and regulations and questioning their existence,2824.0,2826.1600000000003,9,Elon
663, just um,2827.1200000000003,2828.8,4,Elon
664, Like if we've got a function for creating rules and regulations because rules and regulations can also think of it's like they're like,2828.8,2833.92,28,Elon
665, software or lines of code for operating,2834.32,2836.64,9,Elon
666, Civilization. That's the rules and regulations um,2837.84,2840.32,12,Elon
667," So it's like we shouldn't have rules and regulations, but the you have your code accumulation, but no code removal",2841.2000000000003,2846.2400000000002,26,Elon
668, And so it just gets to become basically archaic blood wear after a while,2847.36,2852.08,18,Elon
669, um and then it's just it makes it hard for things to progress,2852.96,2857.2000000000003,16,Elon
670, So i don't know maybe mars you have like a,2857.92,2860.32,13,Elon
671, uh,2861.28,2861.76,3,Elon
672," You know any given law must have a sunset, you know and and uh and require active",2861.76,2867.1200000000003,20,Elon
673, voting to keep,2867.92,2869.6800000000003,5,Elon
674," Restorting to keep it up there, you know",2869.6800000000003,2871.6800000000003,13,Elon
675, um and i actually also say like,2871.6800000000003,2873.6800000000003,9,Elon
676, And these just i don't know recommendations of thoughts and,2874.0,2877.2000000000003,13,Elon
677, Ultimately will be up to the people on Mars to decide but,2878.32,2880.88,14,Elon
678, i think um,2882.0800000000004,2884.0800000000004,5,Elon
679, It should be easier to,2884.2400000000002,2886.0,7,Elon
680, Remove a law than to add one because of the just to overcome the inertia of laws,2886.0,2890.16,19,Elon
681, so,2890.72,2891.76,3,Elon
682, maybe it's like uh,2891.76,2893.76,7,Elon
683, For argument sake you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect,2894.4,2899.2,18,Elon
684, But only a 40% vote to remove it,2899.76,2902.0,11,Elon
685, So let me be the guy you you posted a meme on twitter recently where there's this there's like a row of urinals,2903.44,2909.6,28,Elon
686, And guys just walks all the way across,2910.16,2912.4,10,Elon
687, And he tells you about crypto,2913.12,2915.12,8,Elon
688, So this is this i mean that's how to be so many times i think it maybe even literally uh yeah,2915.2,2920.56,24,Elon
689, Do you think technologically speaking there's any room for ideas of smart contracts that are so on,2921.8399999999997,2926.7999999999997,21,Elon
690, Because you mentioned laws,2927.2799999999997,2929.2799999999997,6,Elon
691, That's an interesting implement use of things like smart contracts to implement the laws by least government's function,2929.2799999999997,2935.7599999999998,22,Elon
692, Like something built on a theory more maybe,2937.2799999999997,2939.52,10,Elon
693, A dog coin that enables smart contracts somehow,2941.12,2944.24,10,Elon
694," I never quite understand this whole smart contracting um, you know",2944.72,2948.56,14,Elon
695, I mean,2949.9199999999996,2951.4399999999996,4,Elon
696, So i'm too downtown status smart contracts,2952.24,2954.24,10,Elon
697," Um, it's a good line",2954.72,2956.72,9,Elon
698, I mean my general approach to any kind of like deal or whatever is just make sure this clarity of understanding,2957.9199999999996,2963.6,23,Elon
699, That's the most important thing,2963.7599999999998,2965.7599999999998,8,Elon
700, And and just keep any kind of deal very very short and simple plain language,2965.8399999999997,2970.3199999999997,17,Elon
701, And just make sure everyone understands this is the deal. Everyone is it clear um and,2971.28,2976.8,19,Elon
702, uh,2977.52,2978.48,3,Elon
703, And then what are the consequences if various things don't happen um,2978.56,2981.52,15,Elon
704, But usually deal deals are um,2982.56,2984.88,8,Elon
705, You know business deals or whatever are a way too long and complex and overly layered and pointlessly,2985.92,2991.6800000000003,21,Elon
706, You mentioned that doge is the people's coin,2992.7200000000003,2996.1600000000003,12,Elon
707," Yeah, and you said that you were literally going space x may consider literally putting",2997.04,3003.2,18,Elon
708, Uh a doge coin on the moon,3003.8399999999997,3006.7999999999997,10,Elon
709, Is it is this something you're still considering um Mars perhaps,3007.52,3010.8799999999997,14,Elon
710," Uh, do you think there's some chance we've talked about political systems on Mars that uh doge coin is the",3011.7599999999998,3017.8399999999997,26,Elon
711, Official currency of Mars that's happening in the future,3018.64,3021.2,12,Elon
712," Well, I think Mars itself will need to have a different currency because you can't synchronize",3021.6,3028.96,21,Elon
713, Judas speed of light,3029.12,3031.12,6,Elon
714," Oh, not easily um, so must be completely stand alone from earth",3031.12,3034.64,16,Elon
715," Well, yeah, because the",3036.56,3038.56,8,Elon
716," Mars is at closest approach. It's four light minutes away roughly and then at first approach. Uh, it's roughly 20 light minutes away",3039.2799999999997,3046.64,30,Elon
717," Uh, maybe a little more um",3047.3599999999997,3049.3599999999997,9,Elon
718, So you can't really have something synchronizing,3050.08,3052.56,11,Elon
719, You know if you get if you've got a 20 minutes to be light issue if it's got a one minute blockchain,3052.7200000000003,3057.28,26,Elon
720," Yeah, it's not going to synchronize probably um",3057.84,3060.32,13,Elon
721," So Mars would would uh, I don't know if Mars would have a cryptocurrency as a thing, but probably seems likely",3061.2000000000003,3066.6400000000003,26,Elon
722," Um, but it would be some kind of localized thing on Mars um",3067.36,3070.48,16,Elon
723, And you let the people decide,3072.32,3074.8,8,Elon
724," Yeah, absolutely",3074.8,3076.8,5,Elon
725," Is that the future of Mars should be up to the Martians uh, yeah, so um",3076.88,3082.5600000000004,21,Elon
726, I think the cryptocurrency thing is an interesting,3084.2400000000002,3086.88,10,Elon
727, approach to,3088.1600000000003,3090.1600000000003,4,Elon
728, reducing the um,3090.1600000000003,3092.1600000000003,5,Elon
729, error in the,3093.6800000000003,3095.6800000000003,5,Elon
730, The database that is called money um,3095.76,3098.96,9,Elon
731," You know, I think I have a pretty deep understanding of the of what money actually is on a practical day-to-day basis",3101.2000000000003,3106.7200000000003,29,Elon
732, because of PayPal um,3106.8,3108.8,6,Elon
733," You know, I really got in deep there um",3110.0800000000004,3113.28,12,Elon
734, And right right now the money system actually for you have practical purposes is is really a bunch of uh heterogeneous,3115.2000000000003,3122.1600000000003,24,Elon
735, Mainframes running uh old cobalt,3123.36,3125.6000000000004,10,Elon
736," Okay, you mean literally that's literally literally what's happening in batch mode",3127.52,3131.44,17,Elon
737," Okay, in batch mode. Yeah, I putty the poor fastest you have to",3131.76,3136.88,19,Elon
738," maintain that code. Okay, that's a",3137.44,3139.76,11,Elon
739, That's a pain that's pain not even for trans coal mall. Yep. It's cobalt,3140.4,3144.7200000000003,23,Elon
740, Like and they stole the banks were still buying mainframes in 2021 and running ancient cobalt code,3145.52,3151.76,22,Elon
741," uh, and uh",3152.56,3154.56,6,Elon
742, You know the the federal service like probably even older than the but what the banks have and they have an old cobalt mainframe,3154.56,3160.8,29,Elon
743, And so now and and so the the the government effectively has editing privileges on the on the money database,3162.0,3168.4,22,Elon
744, And they use those editing privileges to um,3169.76,3172.48,10,Elon
745, Make more money when if they want,3173.44,3175.52,9,Elon
746, And this increases the error in the database that is money,3176.4,3179.44,13,Elon
747," So if I think money should really be viewed through the lens of information theory and uh, and so it's uh",3180.08,3186.56,25,Elon
748, You're kind of like uh like an internet connection like what's the bandwidth?,3187.2000000000003,3190.4,18,Elon
749," Uh, you know, total but rate what is the latency jutter",3190.56,3195.28,16,Elon
750, Pack a drop,3196.1600000000003,3197.36,5,Elon
751, You know,3197.6,3198.64,4,Elon
752, Errors in errors in network,3198.64,3200.64,8,Elon
753, communication,3200.88,3202.64,3,Elon
754," She's thinking money like that basically um, I think that's probably why we think that and and then say what what system",3202.7200000000003,3209.28,27,Elon
755, Uh from an information at 30 standpoint allows an economy to function the best,3210.1600000000003,3214.88,16,Elon
756," uh, and",3215.52,3217.52,5,Elon
757, you know,3218.2400000000002,3220.0,4,Elon
758, crypto is an attempt to reduce the,3220.08,3222.08,9,Elon
759, the error uh in,3222.88,3224.88,6,Elon
760, In in money that is contributed by uh governments,3226.8,3230.48,11,Elon
761, Deluting the money supply as basically a,3231.6,3234.56,10,Elon
762, pernicious for pernicious form of taxation,3234.96,3236.96,12,Elon
763, So both policy in terms of with inflation and actual like technological,3238.88,3244.32,14,Elon
764, cobalt like cryptocurrency takes us into the 21st century in terms of the actual,3244.8,3249.76,19,Elon
765, Systems that allow you to do the transaction to store wealth all those kinds of things,3250.2400000000002,3253.52,18,Elon
766, Like so just think of money as information people um often will think of money as having power in and of itself,3256.8,3262.4,24,Elon
767, um,3262.96,3264.0800000000004,3,Elon
768, It does not money is uh is information and it does not have power in and of itself,3264.0800000000004,3269.6000000000004,20,Elon
769, uh the like you're going to applying the physics,3270.4,3273.92,12,Elon
770, Tools of thinking about things in the limit is helpful if you are stranded on a tropical island um and uh,3274.48,3281.52,23,Elon
771, You have a trillion dollars useless,3283.2000000000003,3285.36,8,Elon
772, Because there's no there's no resource allocation money is a database resource allocation,3287.6000000000004,3292.0800000000004,17,Elon
773, But there's no resource to allocate except for self so money is useless um,3292.56,3297.04,17,Elon
774, Uh,3298.96,3300.96,3,Elon
775, If you're stranded on desert island with no food,3300.96,3303.84,12,Elon
776, You uh all the bitcoin in the world,3304.4,3306.8,10,Elon
777, will,3307.84,3309.84,3,Elon
778," Not stop you from starving yeah, so um",3309.84,3313.84,11,Elon
779, So like to just just think of money as as a,3316.0,3318.4,13,Elon
780, Database for resource allocation um across time and space and,3320.4,3325.28,13,Elon
781, And then what what what system,3326.2400000000002,3328.4,8,Elon
782, Uh it is what what in what form should that that,3329.52,3333.6800000000003,13,Elon
783, database what data system,3334.6400000000003,3336.6400000000003,6,Elon
784, What what what would be most effective now that there's a there is a fundamental issue with um say but coin and its current form,3336.96,3344.6400000000003,28,Elon
785, In that it's the transaction volume is very limited um and uh the,3346.0,3352.0,16,Elon
786, Latency the it's the latency for for probably confirmed transactions to is too long much longer than you'd like,3352.96,3359.36,24,Elon
787, So it's not it's actually not great from,3360.1600000000003,3362.48,12,Elon
788, um,3363.44,3363.76,3,Elon
789, Transaction volume standpoint or early latency standpoint um,3363.76,3367.44,11,Elon
790, So it is perhaps useful as,3369.12,3371.12,8,Elon
791, As to so to solve an aspect of the money database problem,3372.16,3375.92,14,Elon
792, uh,3376.48,3377.76,3,Elon
793, Which is the sort of store of wealth or an in accounting of,3377.76,3381.68,15,Elon
794, relative,3382.2400000000002,3383.28,3,Elon
795, obligations I suppose,3383.28,3385.28,5,Elon
796," Um, but it is not useful as a",3385.28,3387.6,11,Elon
797, currency as a day-to-day currency but people have proposed different technological solutions,3388.56,3393.2799999999997,18,Elon
798," Yeah, lightning network and the layer two technologies on top of that I mean it's it's all it seems to be all kind of a tradeoff",3394.3199999999997,3400.72,32,Elon
799, But the point is it's kind of brilliant to say that just think about it information think about what kind of database,3400.7999999999997,3406.16,25,Elon
800, What kind of infrastructure enables,3406.16,3407.92,7,Elon
801," Yeah, just like for your company um and you need to have some",3407.92,3412.56,16,Elon
802, Thing that it,3413.2799999999997,3414.7999999999997,5,Elon
803, allows for the efficient to to have efficient,3414.7999999999997,3418.16,10,Elon
804, Value ratios between products and services. So you've got this massive number of products and services. A need to,3418.72,3424.48,24,Elon
805, You can't just barter barter. It's like that would be extremely unwieldy,3425.36,3428.88,21,Elon
806, so you need something that gives you the,3429.68,3432.72,10,Elon
807, uh,3433.6,3435.6,3,Elon
808, A ratio of exchange between goods and services,3435.6,3439.04,10,Elon
809, um and and then i did something that allows you to,3439.68,3442.88,13,Elon
810, Shift obligations across time like debt debt and equity shift obligations across time. Then what does what does the best job of that?,3443.92,3451.2,27,Elon
811, um,3451.84,3453.2799999999997,3,Elon
812, Part of the reason why i think there's some um,3453.2799999999997,3455.68,13,Elon
813, Merit's doge coin even though it was obviously created as a joke,3456.0,3459.2,17,Elon
814, um,3459.92,3461.12,3,Elon
815, Is that it it actually does have a much higher,3461.12,3464.72,12,Elon
816, uh transaction volume capability than bitcoin,3465.44,3468.16,8,Elon
817, um,3468.8799999999997,3469.92,3,Elon
818, And the you know the cut the costs of doing a transaction the the the doge coin fee is is very low,3469.92,3475.7599999999998,25,Elon
819, Like right now if you want to do it a bitcoin transaction the price of doing that transaction is very high,3476.08,3480.48,23,Elon
820, So you could not use it effectively for most things,3480.56,3483.68,12,Elon
821, Um and in order nor could it even scale to a high volume um,3484.3999999999996,3487.6,16,Elon
822, Uh,3489.3599999999997,3491.3599999999997,3,Elon
823, And when bitcoin was you know started i guess one around 2008 or something like that um,3491.8399999999997,3496.48,19,Elon
824, The internet connections were much worse than the rj like order of magnitude,3497.44,3502.0,16,Elon
825, I mean it's there's the way way worse you know in 2008 so,3502.32,3507.04,17,Elon
826, So like having us you know a small uh block size or whatever is,3507.68,3512.08,16,Elon
827, You know and and along,3512.8,3514.64,7,Elon
828," Synchronization time is made sense in 2008, but to you know 2021 or fast forward 10 years it's like it's it's like",3514.64,3523.2,30,Elon
829," It's comically low, you know, it's uh",3524.16,3526.16,14,Elon
830, so,3527.04,3528.56,3,Elon
831, um,3528.72,3529.7599999999998,3,Elon
832, And i think there's some value to having a linear increase in the amount of currency that uh is generated um,3530.48,3538.8799999999997,24,Elon
833, So because some amount of the currency you'd like like if a if a if a currency is too deflationary or like uh or should say if if,3540.24,3548.48,33,Elon
834, If a if a currency is,3549.12,3551.12,8,Elon
835, expected to increase in value of time there's reluctance to spend it,3551.12,3554.2400000000002,16,Elon
836, Because they like oh i if i i'll just hold it not spend it because it's scarcity is increasing with time,3555.12,3560.56,25,Elon
837, So if i spend it now then i will regret spending it so i will just you know hold it,3560.64,3565.92,22,Elon
838, um,3566.88,3567.92,3,Elon
839, But if there's,3567.92,3569.36,6,Elon
840, Some delusion of the currency occurring over time that's that's more of an incentive to use it as a currency,3569.36,3573.84,25,Elon
841, so um those coins somewhat randomly has,3574.32,3577.2,9,Elon
842, uh a,3577.9199999999996,3579.9199999999996,4,Elon
843, um,3580.0,3581.2799999999997,3,Elon
844, Just if a fixed number of of sort of coins or hash strings that,3581.2799999999997,3586.64,16,Elon
845, uh,3587.52,3588.48,3,Elon
846," Or generate every year so there's there's some inflation, but it's not a percentage it based it's a it's so that the",3588.48,3594.08,30,Elon
847, It's a fixed number so the percentage of inflation will necessarily decline over time um,3594.72,3601.04,18,Elon
848, So it just i don't i'm not saying that it's like the ideal system for,3602.64,3606.7999999999997,20,Elon
849," A currency, but i think it actually is uh just fundamentally better than",3606.96,3610.8,16,Elon
850, Anything else i've seen just by accident,3612.0800000000004,3614.2400000000002,10,Elon
851, um so,3615.28,3616.4,4,Elon
852, i like i said um around 2008,3616.4,3618.96,9,Elon
853, so you're not uh,3619.76,3621.92,7,Elon
854, You know some people suggested you might be said to oh shina komodo you've previously said you're not,3621.92,3625.92,24,Elon
855, I'm gonna ask you're not for sure,3626.32,3628.1600000000003,11,Elon
856," No i'm sure would you tell us if you were yes, okay",3628.1600000000003,3630.88,16,Elon
857, uh,3631.44,3633.44,3,Elon
858, Do you think it's a feature of bug that he's anonymous or she or they,3633.44,3636.96,19,Elon
859, It's an interesting kind of quirk of human history that there is a particular technology that is a,3638.96,3643.92,22,Elon
860, Completely anonymous inventor,3644.56,3646.56,5,Elon
861, Or creator,3648.96,3650.96,4,Elon
862," Well, I mean you can you can look at the um evolution of ideas",3661.44,3667.6800000000003,17,Elon
863, um before the launch of bitcoin and,3669.2000000000003,3673.2000000000003,9,Elon
864, See who wrote,3674.48,3676.48,5,Elon
865, You know about those ideas um and then i like i don't know exactly i don't know who created but but coin for practical purposes,3677.6,3686.08,29,Elon
866, The evolution of ideas is is pretty clear before that and like it seems as though like nixabo,3686.88,3692.3199999999997,22,Elon
867, Probably more than anyone else,3693.36,3695.36,7,Elon
868, Responsible for the evolution of those ideas,3695.68,3697.68,10,Elon
869, So here he claims not to be so cut so so not commoto but,3698.16,3702.08,17,Elon
870, i'm not sure that's that's neither here nor there uh but he he seems to be the one more,3702.96,3707.7599999999998,24,Elon
871, Responsible for the ideas behind but quite anyone else,3707.7599999999998,3709.7599999999998,12,Elon
872, So it's not perhaps like singular figures aren't even as important as the,3710.88,3714.7999999999997,17,Elon
873," The figures involved in the evolution of ideas that led to a thing so yeah, yeah, it's you know",3715.36,3720.1600000000003,24,Elon
874," And most perhaps it's sad to think about history, but maybe most names would be forgotten anyway",3720.7200000000003,3726.48,21,Elon
875, What is the name anyway? It's a name name attached to an idea,3726.88,3730.48,17,Elon
876, What does it mean really? I think Shakespeare had a thing about roses and stuff whatever he said,3732.0800000000004,3736.96,21,Elon
877, Rose by any other name. It's well sweet,3737.2000000000003,3739.36,12,Elon
878, I,3740.32,3742.32,3,Elon
879, Got you on the quote Shakespeare. I feel I feel like I accomplished something today,3742.32,3746.2400000000002,18,Elon
880, Show like a pali to a summer stay,3746.88,3748.88,11,Elon
881, I'm gonna clip that out,3750.0,3752.0,8,Elon
882, Um no more tempered animal fair,3753.6800000000003,3755.6800000000003,9,Elon
883, Autopilot test a lot of,3758.88,3761.1200000000003,9,Elon
884, um,3764.08,3766.08,3,Elon
885, Does the autopilot has been through an incredible journey over the past six years,3766.16,3769.6,17,Elon
886, Or perhaps even longer in the minds of in your mind in the minds of many involved,3770.48,3774.96,19,Elon
887," Uh, I think that's where we first like connected really was the autopilot stuff autonomy and what's the whole journey was",3776.64,3782.88,27,Elon
888, Incredible to me to watch I was um,3783.36,3785.92,10,Elon
889, Because I knew well part of it as I was at MIT and I knew the difficulty of computer vision,3787.68,3792.64,22,Elon
890, And I knew the whole I had a lot of colleagues and friends about the DARPA challenge and you how difficult it is,3793.2,3797.92,26,Elon
891, And so there was a natural skepticism when I first drove a Tesla with uh the initial system based on mobile. I yeah,3798.4,3805.12,27,Elon
892, I thought there's no way,3805.2,3807.2,8,Elon
893, So first one I got in I thought there's no way this car could maintain,3807.44,3811.2799999999997,18,Elon
894, Um like staying in lane and create a comfortable experience,3812.48,3815.6,12,Elon
895, So my intuition initially was that the lane keeping problem is way too difficult to solve,3815.92,3821.12,18,Elon
896," Oh, thank you. Yeah, that's really easy. Yeah, well yeah",3821.7599999999998,3824.3199999999997,18,Elon
897," But like uh, but not the what's solved in the way that we just we talked about previous is prototype",3824.96,3830.16,24,Elon
898, versus a thing that actually creates a pleasant experience over hundreds of thousands of miles or no,3830.96,3836.56,19,Elon
899," Hey, yeah, so",3837.2,3839.2,7,Elon
900, We had to wrap a lot of code around the mobile I think it doesn't just didn't just work by itself,3839.2,3843.44,25,Elon
901, I mean that there's part that's part of the story of how you approach things sometimes sometimes you do things from scratch,3844.16,3849.2799999999997,26,Elon
902, Sometimes the first you kind of see what's out there and then you decide different scratch,3849.6800000000003,3853.92,19,Elon
903, That was one of the boldest decisions,3854.32,3856.7200000000003,10,Elon
904, I've seen is both on the hardware and the software to decide to eventually go from scratch,3856.7200000000003,3860.5600000000004,20,Elon
905," I thought again, I was skeptical whether that's going to be able to work out because it's such a such a difficult problem",3860.96,3866.1600000000003,28,Elon
906, and so it was an incredible journey what I see now with um,3866.88,3870.2400000000002,15,Elon
907, everything the hardware the compute the sensors the,3871.0400000000004,3873.44,10,Elon
908, The things I maybe care and love about most is the the stuff that,3874.4,3878.64,16,Elon
909, Andre Carpati is leading with the data sets selection the whole data engine process then you'll network architectures,3878.88,3884.48,24,Elon
910, The way that's in the real world that network is tested validated all the different test sets,3885.04,3890.64,20,Elon
911, You know versus the image net model of computer vision like what's in academia is like real world artificial intelligence,3892.0,3899.52,23,Elon
912, so,3899.92,3901.68,3,Elon
913," Andre is awesome and I was to play some important role, but we have a lot of really talented people driving things so",3901.8399999999997,3907.9199999999996,26,Elon
914, And a show is actually the head of autopilot engineering,3909.6,3912.56,13,Elon
915," Andre is director of AI AI stuff. Yeah, so yeah, there's I'm aware that there's an incredible team of just a lot going on",3914.7999999999997,3922.0,32,Elon
916," Yeah, I just you know, I feel people will give off will give me too much credit and they'll give Andre too much credit",3922.08,3927.2799999999997,29,Elon
917, so,3927.68,3928.72,3,Elon
918," And people should realize how much is going on under the yeah, it's a lot of really talented people",3928.72,3934.24,23,Elon
919, The tells the autopilot the IT is extremely talented. It's like some of the smartest people in the world,3936.56,3942.24,24,Elon
920," um, so yeah, we're getting it done. What are some insights you've gained over those",3942.7999999999997,3948.16,22,Elon
921, five six years of autopilot about the problem of a time was driving so you leaped in,3949.2799999999997,3956.0,21,Elon
922," Having some sort of first principles kinds of intuitions, but nobody knows how difficult the",3956.88,3963.12,19,Elon
923," Yeah, like I thought the self-driving problem would be hard, but it was harder than I thought so like I thought it'd be easy",3964.0,3969.92,31,Elon
924," I thought it'd be very hard, but it was actually way harder than than even that so",3969.92,3974.48,21,Elon
925, I want to come down to you at the end of the day is the soul self-driving,3975.6,3978.4,21,Elon
926, You have to solve,3979.6,3981.6,6,Elon
927, You you basically need to recreate,3982.56,3985.68,8,Elon
928, What do what humans do to drive which is humans drive with optical sensors eyes and biological neural nets,3987.04,3993.52,21,Elon
929, And so in order to that does how the entire road system is designed to work with with a,3994.7999999999997,3999.68,21,Elon
930, basically passive optical and neural nets,4000.96,4003.68,8,Elon
931, It biologically and now that we need to so for actually for full self-driving to work,4005.12,4009.7599999999998,21,Elon
932, We have to recreate that in digital form,4010.0,4012.0,10,Elon
933, So we have to,4012.88,4014.88,6,Elon
934, That means cameras with,4014.88,4016.88,6,Elon
935, advanced,4018.48,4020.48,3,Elon
936, neural nets in silicon form,4020.48,4022.48,7,Elon
937, And then you it will obviously solve for full self-driving. That's the only way. I don't think there's any other way,4024.0800000000004,4029.92,30,Elon
938, But the question is what aspects of human nature do you have to encode into the machine?,4030.2400000000002,4034.7200000000003,21,Elon
939," Right, so you have to solve the perception problem like detect",4035.2000000000003,4037.6800000000003,14,Elon
940, And then you first or while it realize,4038.64,4040.7999999999997,10,Elon
941, What is the perception problem for driving like all the kinds of things you have to be able to see like what what do we even look at when we drive,4041.2799999999997,4047.3599999999997,33,Elon
942," There's uh, I just recently heard Andre talked about at MIT about like car doors",4047.9199999999996,4053.6,19,Elon
943, I think it was the world's greatest talk of all time about car doors. Yeah,4053.7599999999998,4057.2,19,Elon
944, The you know the fine details of car doors like what what is even an open car door man,4058.16,4063.8399999999997,21,Elon
945, So like the the ontology of that that's the perception problem we human solve that perception problem,4064.48,4069.6800000000003,21,Elon
946, Antesla has to solve that problem and then there's the control and the planning coupled with the perception,4069.84,4074.48,23,Elon
947, yet to figure out like,4074.96,4076.8,7,Elon
948, What's involved in driving like especially in all the different edge cases,4076.8,4080.6400000000003,15,Elon
949," um, and then I mean",4081.36,4083.6800000000003,8,Elon
950, Maybe you can comment on this,4084.4,4086.4,8,Elon
951, How much game the erratic kind of stuff needs to be involved you know at a four-way stop sign,4086.56,4092.4,24,Elon
952, You know are as humans when we drive our actions affect the world like sure it changes how others behave most of time was driving if you,4093.28,4102.4800000000005,29,Elon
953, You're usually just responding,4103.4400000000005,4105.4400000000005,7,Elon
954, To the scene as opposed to like really um asserting yourself in the scene. Do you think,4106.32,4111.76,21,Elon
955, I think these so I think I think these could these sort of control control logic,4113.12,4116.8,18,Elon
956, Conundrums are not come are not the hot part um,4117.12,4120.0,15,Elon
957," The you know, let's see um",4120.8,4123.76,10,Elon
958, What do you think is the hard part in this whole,4125.44,4127.44,13,Elon
959, Um beautiful complex problem. So it's a lot of freaking software man a lot of smart lines of code um,4128.64,4134.88,24,Elon
960, Uh for sure in order to have um,4136.24,4140.32,10,Elon
961," Create an accurate vector space. Uh, so",4141.52,4144.24,11,Elon
962, Like you you you're you're coming from image space,4145.28,4147.92,13,Elon
963, Which is like this this flow of um photons cut you're going to camera cameras and,4148.24,4154.72,19,Elon
964, uh and then uh,4155.28,4157.12,6,Elon
965, So you have this massive boot stream,4157.84,4159.84,9,Elon
966," um in an image space uh, and then you have to",4160.4800000000005,4164.16,14,Elon
967, uh effectively compress uh the uh,4164.88,4167.52,8,Elon
968, uh,4168.56,4169.76,3,Elon
969, massive,4169.76,4170.96,3,Elon
970, boot stream uh,4170.96,4172.96,5,Elon
971, corresponding to,4174.4,4176.24,4,Elon
972, photons that,4176.24,4177.76,4,Elon
973, knocked off an electron in a camera sensor,4177.76,4180.32,10,Elon
974, Uh and turn that,4181.36,4182.8,6,Elon
975, put stream into into vector space um,4182.8,4185.599999999999,9,Elon
976, uh by by vector space. I mean like uh,4186.8,4190.08,12,Elon
977," You know, you've got",4191.679999999999,4193.2,8,Elon
978, cars and and humans and uh,4193.2,4195.5199999999995,8,Elon
979, lane lines and curves and,4196.5599999999995,4198.5599999999995,7,Elon
980, uh,4199.599999999999,4200.639999999999,3,Elon
981, traffic lights and that kind of thing um,4200.639999999999,4203.12,10,Elon
982, What once you uh have an accurate vector space um,4203.92,4208.16,12,Elon
983, The control problem is,4208.48,4210.16,6,Elon
984, So much that of a video game like a grand theft order of cyberpunk um if you have accurate accurate best vector space,4210.16,4216.16,26,Elon
985, It's the control problem is,4216.24,4218.24,8,Elon
986, It's it's it's it's trivial. It's not trivial but it's um,4218.24,4221.04,20,Elon
987, Like it's it's it's it's it's it's not like some,4222.64,4225.599999999999,18,Elon
988, insurmountable thing. It's a so it's but having an accurate vector space,4226.96,4230.32,20,Elon
989," It's very difficult. Yeah, I think we humans uh",4231.04,4233.5199999999995,14,Elon
990, Don't give enough respect to how incredible the human perception system is to mapping the raw,4234.4,4239.759999999999,19,Elon
991, photons to the vector space representation in our heads,4240.88,4243.759999999999,11,Elon
992, Your brain is doing an incredible amount of processing um,4244.639999999999,4247.5199999999995,12,Elon
993, And giving you an image that is a very cleaned up image like when we look around here,4248.32,4252.5599999999995,20,Elon
994," We seek like you see color in the corners of your eyes, but actually your eyes have very few uh",4252.5599999999995,4257.84,23,Elon
995, uh,4258.64,4258.88,3,Elon
996, cones like the,4258.88,4260.16,5,Elon
997, Conor sectors in the peripheral vision,4260.16,4262.16,9,Elon
998," Your your your eyes are painting color in the peripheral vision. You don't realize it, but their eyes are actually",4262.24,4267.68,25,Elon
999, painting color and,4268.32,4270.16,5,Elon
1000, Your eyes also have like this blood vessels and also to gnarly things and there's a blind spot,4270.16,4274.56,23,Elon
1001," But do you see your blind spot? No, you're",4274.56,4276.96,14,Elon
1002, Your brain is painting in the missing the blind spot and you're gonna do these like,4277.76,4282.16,19,Elon
1003, See these things online where you look look here and look at this point and then look at this point,4282.8,4287.360000000001,22,Elon
1004, And it's,4287.44,4288.639999999999,5,Elon
1005, It's if it's in your blind spot it your brain will just fill in the,4288.639999999999,4292.0,19,Elon
1006," The missing vessel the peripheral vision circle. Yeah, you realize all the illusions for vision science",4292.5599999999995,4297.92,20,Elon
1007, So it makes you realize just how incredible the brain is the brains don't crazy amount of post processing on the vision signals for your eyes,4297.92,4304.5599999999995,29,Elon
1008," um, it's insane",4305.28,4307.44,7,Elon
1009, so um,4307.679999999999,4309.2,4,Elon
1010, And then even once you get all those vision signals,4309.2,4311.679999999999,12,Elon
1011, Your your your brain is constantly trying to figure to forget as much as possible,4312.320000000001,4317.280000000001,17,Elon
1012, So human memory is,4317.68,4319.52,6,Elon
1013, Perhaps the weakest thing about the brain is memory,4319.52,4321.68,11,Elon
1014, so because memory is,4322.0,4324.0,6,Elon
1015, So expensive to a brain and so limited your brain is trying to forget as much as possible and to still,4324.0,4330.400000000001,23,Elon
1016, the things that you see into,4331.12,4333.12,8,Elon
1017, The smallest the smallest amounts of information possible,4333.6,4336.56,10,Elon
1018, So brain is trying to not just get to a vector space,4336.56,4339.360000000001,14,Elon
1019, But get to a vector space that is the smallest possible vector space of only relevant objects,4339.44,4344.88,19,Elon
1020," Um, and I think like",4345.839999999999,4347.839999999999,8,Elon
1021, You can sort of look inside your brain or at least I can like when you drive down the road and try to,4348.08,4354.08,25,Elon
1022, Think about what your brain is actually doing consciously,4354.96,4358.16,11,Elon
1023, And it's it's it's it's it's it's like you'll see a car that's,4358.96,4363.92,23,Elon
1024, You could because you're you're you don't have cameras you don't have eyes in the back of your head or inside,4364.32,4368.48,27,Elon
1025," You know, so you say like",4368.719999999999,4370.48,9,Elon
1026," You basically your head is like a you know, you basically have like two cameras on a slow gimbal",4370.879999999999,4376.639999999999,22,Elon
1027, um and and what's you,4377.28,4379.12,8,Elon
1028," And I said something great. Okay, here and I is uh, you know like um and people constantly distracted and thinking about things and texting and doing",4380.4,4387.919999999999,32,Elon
1029, Also things they shouldn't do in a car changing the radio station and so,4387.919999999999,4391.2,17,Elon
1030," Having arguments, you know is like um",4392.719999999999,4395.2,10,Elon
1031, So so then like say like like,4396.16,4398.88,9,Elon
1032, Uh,4400.08,4401.04,3,Elon
1033, Like when's the last time you look right and left and you know or and and rare word um or even diagonally,4401.04,4406.16,26,Elon
1034, You know forward,4407.04,4408.24,5,Elon
1035, To actually refresh your vector space,4408.24,4410.4,8,Elon
1036, So you're glancing around and what you're minus doing is is is trying to still um the relevant vectors basically objects with a position and motion,4411.2,4420.96,31,Elon
1037, uh and,4421.599999999999,4423.599999999999,4,Elon
1038, and then and then uh,4424.0,4426.0,7,Elon
1039, Editing that down to the least amount that's necessary for you to drive it does seem to be able to,4426.0,4431.120000000001,24,Elon
1040," Uh, edit it down or compress it even further into things like concepts",4431.92,4435.76,16,Elon
1041, So it's not it's like it goes beyond the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space,4435.76,4440.64,22,Elon
1042, To sort of space of concepts to where you you'll see a thing. It's no longer represented spatially somehow,4441.280000000001,4447.200000000001,25,Elon
1043, It's almost like a concept that you should be aware of like if this is a school zone,4447.52,4451.84,21,Elon
1044, You'll remember that yeah as a concept which is a weird thing to represent but perhaps for driving you don't,4452.24,4457.76,24,Elon
1045, Need to fully represent those things or maybe you get those kind of um,4458.96,4462.72,16,Elon
1046," Well, you indirectly you need it's like a salvage vector space and then",4464.400000000001,4468.08,18,Elon
1047, Actually have predictions for uh that those vector spaces so like um you know like if uh,4469.360000000001,4476.64,19,Elon
1048, You know like you drive past say say,4478.400000000001,4480.88,10,Elon
1049, uh,4480.88,4482.88,3,Elon
1050, Abus and then and you see that this,4483.4400000000005,4485.28,11,Elon
1051, There's people before you drove past the bus you saw people were crossing,4486.0,4489.6,16,Elon
1052, It's like or some just imagine there's like a large,4489.84,4491.92,14,Elon
1053, truck or something blocking site,4492.56,4494.56,7,Elon
1054, um,4494.64,4495.4400000000005,3,Elon
1055, But you before you came up to the truck you saw that there were some kids about to cross the road,4495.4400000000005,4500.08,23,Elon
1056," In front of the truck now you can no longer see the kids, but you you need to be able but you would now know",4500.72,4505.92,28,Elon
1057," Okay, those kids are probably gonna pass by the truck and cross the road",4505.92,4509.68,17,Elon
1058, Even though you cannot see them so you have to have um,4510.56,4513.4400000000005,14,Elon
1059, memory,4515.280000000001,4517.04,3,Elon
1060, That you have to need to remember that there were kids there and you need to have some forward prediction of what their,4517.04,4522.4800000000005,25,Elon
1061, position will be really hard problem at the time of relevance so with with occlusions,4523.280000000001,4526.8,19,Elon
1062, And computer vision when you can't see an object anymore,4527.52,4530.320000000001,13,Elon
1063, Even when it just walks behind a tree and reappears. That's a really really,4530.72,4534.400000000001,20,Elon
1064, I mean at least in academic literature,4535.04,4537.04,9,Elon
1065," Tracking through occlusions. It's very difficult. Yeah, we're doing it. Um, I understand this yeah",4537.6,4542.96,27,Elon
1066, So some of it it's like object permanence like same thing happens with the humans with your neural nets like if it when like a toddler grows up like there's a there's a point in time where,4543.5199999999995,4552.08,43,Elon
1067," Uh, they develop they have a sense of object permanence. So before a certain age if you have a ball",4552.8,4558.24,25,Elon
1068," Uh, or a toy or whatever and you put it behind your back and you pop it out",4559.04,4562.08,21,Elon
1069," If they don't before they have object permanence, it's like a new thing every time. It's like whoa this",4562.64,4566.64,27,Elon
1070, Toya went boof just spared and now it's back again and they can't believe it and that they can play peekaboo all day long because the peekaboo is fresh every time,4567.04,4573.6,41,Elon
1071, But then we figured out object permanence then they realized oh no the object is not gone. It's just behind you back,4576.24,4581.2,27,Elon
1072," Um, sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence",4582.0,4585.68,15,Elon
1073," Yeah, so that's uh",4586.4,4588.4,8,Elon
1074, That's an important problem to solve,4589.2,4591.2,9,Elon
1075," Yes, so so in an like an important evolution of the neural nets in the car is uh",4591.68,4596.48,21,Elon
1076, um,4597.68,4599.68,3,Elon
1077," Memory a car memory across both time and space um, so",4600.0,4604.08,14,Elon
1078," Uh, now you can't remember like you have to say like how long do you want to remember things for and and it's",4605.12,4609.68,28,Elon
1079, There's a cost to remembering things for a long time,4610.08,4613.28,13,Elon
1080, So you could you know like run out of memory to try to remember too much for too long,4613.28,4617.92,21,Elon
1081," Um, and then you also have things that are stale if if they're",4618.56,4622.08,18,Elon
1082, From remember for too long and then you also need things that are remember,4622.48,4625.04,16,Elon
1083, Remember it over time so even if you like say have like,4625.68,4629.6,14,Elon
1084, For I'm gonna say five seconds of memory on a time basis,4630.64,4634.16,15,Elon
1085, But like let's say you you you're parked at a light and you and you saw,4634.56,4638.16,20,Elon
1086, You used a pedestrian example that people were waiting to cross the,4639.36,4642.88,14,Elon
1087, Across the road and you can't you can't quite see them because I'm an occlusion,4643.84,4647.36,21,Elon
1088," Uh, but they might wait for a minute before the light changes for them to cross the road",4648.0,4652.8,21,Elon
1089, You still need to remember that they that that's where they were,4653.2,4656.320000000001,15,Elon
1090," Um, and that they're probably going to cross the road type of thing um, so even if that exceeds your",4656.96,4661.92,25,Elon
1091, Your time-based memory should not exceed your space of memory,4663.28,4666.8,14,Elon
1092, And I just think the data engine side of that so getting the data to learn all of the concepts that you're saying now,4668.08,4674.400000000001,27,Elon
1093, Is an incredible process. It's this iterative process of just it's this this hydrant of many,4674.96,4680.24,23,Elon
1094, I should know,4680.48,4682.48,5,Elon
1095, We're changing the name to something else. Okay. I'm sure it'll be equally as,4683.36,4687.84,21,Elon
1096," Yeah Rick and Morty like there's a lot of it. Yeah, yeah, we've we all detected the neural net",4688.24,4693.599999999999,27,Elon
1097," Uh, neural nets in the cars so many times it's crazy",4694.16,4697.2,15,Elon
1098, Also every time there's a new major version you'll rename it to something more ridiculous or,4697.92,4702.16,20,Elon
1099, I or memorable and beautiful. Sorry now ridiculous of course,4702.719999999999,4706.08,13,Elon
1100, If you if you see the full the full like a ray of neural nets that that operatingly cars it's kind of boggles the mind,4706.16,4715.28,31,Elon
1101, This so there's so many layers. It's crazy um,4715.6,4718.8,14,Elon
1102, so,4720.0,4721.44,3,Elon
1103, Yeah,4721.44,4722.64,3,Elon
1104," um, but and we we saw it off with uh",4722.64,4727.12,13,Elon
1105, Simple neural nets that were uh basically,4728.08,4731.2,9,Elon
1106, It image recognition on a single frame,4732.16,4734.16,9,Elon
1107, from a single camera and then,4734.96,4737.44,8,Elon
1108, Trying to net those together with it you know it with the c,4738.88,4743.36,15,Elon
1109, I should say we were really primarily running c here because c++ is uh,4744.4,4749.28,17,Elon
1110, So it's too much overhead and we have our own c compiler,4749.36,4751.12,15,Elon
1111, So to get maximum performance we actually wrote wrote our own c compiler and are continuing to optimize our c compiler for,4751.679999999999,4758.24,24,Elon
1112, Maximum efficiency in fact we've just recently,4759.04,4761.04,11,Elon
1113, Uh done a new rev on on a on a c compiler that'll compile directly to our autopilot hardware,4761.76,4766.5599999999995,23,Elon
1114," Um, do you want to compile the whole thing down and with your own compiler? Yeah, like so efficiently here",4766.88,4771.92,25,Elon
1115, The good because there's all kinds of compute their CPU GPU. There's like the basic types of things,4772.4,4776.5599999999995,23,Elon
1116, That's and you have to somehow figure out the scheduling across all of those things and so you're compiling the code down,4776.5599999999995,4781.679999999999,27,Elon
1117," Yeah, it does all the okay",4782.08,4784.08,9,Elon
1118, This is so that's why there's a lot of people involved,4784.08,4786.48,15,Elon
1119, This is this is a lot of hardcore uh software engineering at a very sort of,4787.44,4791.759999999999,18,Elon
1120, Bare metal level,4793.12,4794.639999999999,5,Elon
1121, Because you we're trying to do a lot of compute uh that's constrained to the,4794.639999999999,4799.44,19,Elon
1122, You know our full self-driving computer. So and we want to try to have the highest frames per second,4800.879999999999,4806.639999999999,24,Elon
1123, possible,4807.679999999999,4809.679999999999,3,Elon
1124, With in a sort of very finite amount of compute um and power so,4810.08,4815.44,16,Elon
1125, um,4816.959999999999,4818.16,3,Elon
1126, We really put a lot of effort into the efficiency of our compute um,4818.16,4822.4,16,Elon
1127," And uh, so there's actually a lot of work done by",4823.759999999999,4826.24,15,Elon
1128, It's a very talented software engineers at Tesla that uh at a very foundational level to improve the efficiency of compute and how we use the,4827.5199999999995,4836.4,29,Elon
1129, The tripe accelerators which are basically um,4837.36,4840.16,11,Elon
1130, um,4841.12,4841.68,3,Elon
1131, Dot you know uh during matrix math dot dot products like a Brazilian dot products,4841.68,4846.639999999999,17,Elon
1132, You know and it's like what what what what are neural assets like,4847.28,4849.92,16,Elon
1133, compute wise like 99% dot products,4850.72,4853.04,9,Elon
1134, so,4854.4,4856.08,3,Elon
1135, You know um and you want to achieve as many high frame rates like video game you want yeah for full resolution,4856.08,4862.8,24,Elon
1136, High frame rate high frame rate low latency,4863.84,4866.48,10,Elon
1137, um,4867.36,4869.2,3,Elon
1138, low jitter uh so um,4869.28,4871.76,8,Elon
1139, um,4872.48,4874.0,3,Elon
1140, I think one of the things we're um moving towards now is no post processing of the,4875.2,4881.04,20,Elon
1141, image through the um,4882.08,4884.08,6,Elon
1142, uh the image signal processor so um,4884.72,4888.24,9,Elon
1143, Like for what happens for cameras is that what almost look cameras is they,4889.04,4893.679999999999,16,Elon
1144, um,4894.96,4895.76,3,Elon
1145, That there's a lot of post processing done in order to make pictures look pretty,4895.76,4899.280000000001,18,Elon
1146," Uh, and so we don't care about pictures looking pretty um",4900.24,4902.96,15,Elon
1147, We we just want the data,4903.4400000000005,4904.96,8,Elon
1148, We so we're we're moving to just roll roll photon counts,4905.2,4907.84,15,Elon
1149, So the system will,4908.8,4910.8,6,Elon
1150, Like the,4910.96,4912.320000000001,4,Elon
1151, Image that,4912.320000000001,4913.84,4,Elon
1152, That the computer sees is actually much more than what each see if you're represented on a camera. Let's go much more data,4913.84,4920.08,28,Elon
1153," Uh, and even in very low light conditions",4920.8,4922.56,11,Elon
1154, You can see that there's a small photon count difference between,4922.64,4925.68,14,Elon
1155, You know the spot here and that's about there which means that so it can see in the dark incredibly well,4926.56,4931.84,24,Elon
1156, Um because it can detect these tiny differences in photon counts,4932.72,4935.92,13,Elon
1157, That's much better than you'd put possibly imagine um so and then we also save,4936.96,4943.120000000001,19,Elon
1158, uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh so,4943.76,4947.68,10,Elon
1159, Um from removing the post processing and the image. Yes. Yeah. It's like,4948.56,4952.320000000001,19,Elon
1160, um,4953.280000000001,4954.160000000001,3,Elon
1161, Because we've got you know eight cameras and and then there's uh,4954.240000000001,4957.04,16,Elon
1162, Roughly I don't know one half milliseconds also,4959.04,4961.200000000001,12,Elon
1163, Maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um,4962.0,4964.240000000001,10,Elon
1164, For each camera and so it like uh um,4965.280000000001,4969.84,11,Elon
1165, Going to just uh,4970.72,4972.72,6,Elon
1166, It basically bypassing the image processor uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of latency which is important,4972.88,4979.200000000001,20,Elon
1167, um,4980.0,4981.200000000001,3,Elon
1168, And we track latency all the way from you know photon hits the the camera to,4981.44,4985.76,18,Elon
1169, You know all the steps that it's gonna go through to get you go through the,4986.5599999999995,4989.599999999999,19,Elon
1170, um,4990.24,4991.36,3,Elon
1171, The various neural nets and the the C code and,4991.36,4993.76,12,Elon
1172, And there's a little bit of C++ there as well,4994.5599999999995,4996.5599999999995,14,Elon
1173, um,4996.88,4997.76,3,Elon
1174," Well, I can maybe a lot but it the core stuff is it the heavy-duty computer's all in C um",4997.76,5003.599999999999,27,Elon
1175, And uh,5005.12,5006.88,4,Elon
1176, And so so we track that latency all the way to an output command to the um,5006.88,5010.8,19,Elon
1177, Drive you know to accelerate uh the brakes just to slow down steering your turn left or right um,5011.5199999999995,5017.92,21,Elon
1178, So because you got to output a command that's gonna go to controller and like some of these controllers have an update frequency,5018.88,5024.08,26,Elon
1179, That's maybe uh ten hertz or something like that which is slow. That's like now you lose 100 milliseconds potentially,5024.16,5029.5199999999995,25,Elon
1180, so,5030.24,5031.76,3,Elon
1181, So then we want to update the,5031.84,5033.84,9,Elon
1182, The drivers on the,5035.04,5036.88,6,Elon
1183, Like say it's steering and braking control to have um,5036.88,5039.84,13,Elon
1184, More like uh,5040.8,5041.84,5,Elon
1185, Outer towards instead of ten hosts and you got a ten milliseconds latency instead of 100 milliseconds worst case latency,5041.84,5046.24,23,Elon
1186, And actually jitter is more of a challenge than than latency because latency is like you can you can,5046.400000000001,5051.04,22,Elon
1187, You can't just pay to predict but if you,5051.04,5053.04,12,Elon
1188, But if you've got a stack up of things going from the camera to the to the computer,5053.04,5056.72,21,Elon
1189, Through then a series of other computers and finally to an actuator on the to the car if you have a stack up of,5057.28,5063.28,27,Elon
1190," Of tolerances of timing tolerances, then you can have quite a variable latency which school jitter",5065.12,5069.68,22,Elon
1191, And and that makes it a hard to,5070.32,5072.8,10,Elon
1192, To anticipate exactly what how you should turn the car or accelerate because you know if you got maybe,5073.52,5079.28,21,Elon
1193, 150 turn-off milliseconds of jitter then you could be off by you know about to point two seconds,5080.0,5084.96,23,Elon
1194, And this can make this could make a big difference,5085.52,5087.52,12,Elon
1195, So you have to interpolate somehow to to to uh deal with the effects of jitter so the they can make like,5087.52,5093.92,26,Elon
1196, robust control decisions,5094.96,5096.96,5,Elon
1197," Yeah, you have to so the jitter is in the sensor information always the jitter can occur at any stage in the pipeline",5097.92,5104.8,28,Elon
1198, You can if you have just if you have fixed latency you can anticipate um,5105.04,5109.44,17,Elon
1199," And and like say okay, we know that uh",5110.4,5112.88,12,Elon
1200, Our information is for argument sake 150 milliseconds stale,5114.16,5118.16,12,Elon
1201, Like so for 140 more for argument sake 150 milliseconds from,5118.8,5123.04,13,Elon
1202, Photos taken camera to,5123.68,5125.68,7,Elon
1203, Where you can measure a change in the acceleration of the vehicle,5126.64,5130.64,14,Elon
1204," So then uh then you can say okay, well we're gonna",5133.76,5136.96,15,Elon
1205," And so we know it's 150 milliseconds, so we're gonna take that into account and uh",5137.68,5141.360000000001,21,Elon
1206, And compensate for that latency however if you if you got then 150 milliseconds of latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter,5142.8,5148.8,24,Elon
1207, That's which could be anywhere from zero zero to 100 milliseconds on top,5149.200000000001,5152.240000000001,16,Elon
1208, So so then your latency could be from,5152.48,5154.24,10,Elon
1209, 150 to 50 milliseconds now you got 100 milliseconds that you don't know what to do with and uh that's basically random,5154.4,5159.84,26,Elon
1210, So getting rid of jitter is extremely important,5161.36,5163.36,11,Elon
1211, And that affects your control decisions and all those kinds of things,5164.24,5166.8,14,Elon
1212, Okay,5167.44,5169.12,3,Elon
1213," Yeah, the cars is gonna fundamentally maneuver better with lower jitter um",5169.12,5172.32,16,Elon
1214, Got it,5172.96,5173.76,4,Elon
1215, The the the cause will maneuver with superhuman ability and reaction time much faster than a human,5174.16,5178.88,20,Elon
1216," I mean, I think over time the",5179.84,5182.16,10,Elon
1217, It tells the autopilot full-stop driving will be capable of maneuvers that um,5182.96,5187.2,19,Elon
1218, you know,5188.16,5190.16,4,Elon
1219, You know are far more than what like James Bond could do and like in the best movie type of thing,5192.400000000001,5196.32,23,Elon
1220, That's exactly where I was imagining in my mind as you said it,5196.400000000001,5199.2,16,Elon
1221," It's like an impossible maneuver that a human couldn't do you know, so",5200.24,5203.36,18,Elon
1222," Well, let me ask sort of uh looking back the six years looking out into the future",5204.0,5209.839999999999,20,Elon
1223, Based on your current understanding how hard do you think this this full self-driving problem when do you think Tesla will solve level 4 fsd?,5210.24,5218.5599999999995,32,Elon
1224," I mean, it's looking quite likely that it will be next year",5220.88,5223.2,16,Elon
1225, And what is the solution look like is it the current pool of fsd beta candidates,5225.44,5229.839999999999,20,Elon
1226, They start getting greater and greater as they have been degrees of autonomy and then there's a certain level beyond which,5230.32,5238.400000000001,24,Elon
1227, They can they can they can do their own they can read a book,5239.28,5241.4400000000005,16,Elon
1228," Yeah, so uh",5242.88,5244.88,6,Elon
1229, I mean you can see that anybody who's been falling the,5245.6,5247.68,14,Elon
1230, full-stop driving beta closely um we'll see that the um,5248.400000000001,5252.24,15,Elon
1231, The,5253.2,5254.16,3,Elon
1232, rated disengagement has been dropping rapidly,5254.24,5256.8,10,Elon
1233, So like a disengagement beware where the driver intervenes to prevent the car from doing something right uh dangerous potentially so um,5257.44,5265.599999999999,28,Elon
1234, So the interventions,5269.68,5271.2,5,Elon
1235, You know per a million miles has been dropping dramatically at some point the,5272.16,5276.0,16,Elon
1236, And that trend looks like it it happens next year is,5277.5199999999995,5281.28,13,Elon
1237, That the,5282.24,5283.599999999999,4,Elon
1238, probability of an accident on fsd is,5283.599999999999,5287.44,11,Elon
1239, Less than that of the average human and then and then significantly less than that of the average human um,5288.8,5293.44,22,Elon
1240, so,5294.32,5296.08,3,Elon
1241, It suddenly appears like we will get there next year,5296.16,5299.759999999999,12,Elon
1242, um,5300.5599999999995,5301.84,3,Elon
1243, Then of course that that then there's going to be a case of okay will we not prove the straggulators and prove it to you know,5301.84,5307.84,31,Elon
1244, And and we we want a standard that is not just equivalent to a human but,5307.92,5312.08,18,Elon
1245, Uh much better than the average human. I think it's got to be at least two or three times uh higher,5312.96,5317.360000000001,25,Elon
1246, Safety than a human so two or three times lower probability of injury than a human,5318.0,5321.84,18,Elon
1247," Um before before we would actually say like okay, it's okay to go. It's it's not gonna be a cool. It's got to be much better",5322.4800000000005,5327.52,35,Elon
1248, So if you look uh 10 point the fsd,5328.32,5330.4800000000005,13,Elon
1249, 10.6 just came out recently 10.7s on the way,5331.360000000001,5334.64,16,Elon
1250," Maybe 11 is on the way so we're in the future. Yeah, um we were hoping to get 11 out this year, but it's uh",5335.360000000001,5341.68,32,Elon
1251," Yeah, 11 actually has a whole bunch of",5342.8,5345.12,11,Elon
1252, uh,5345.52,5346.320000000001,3,Elon
1253, fundamental rewrites on the neural neural net architecture,5346.320000000001,5349.280000000001,12,Elon
1254, um and some,5349.84,5351.52,5,Elon
1255, fundamental improvements uh in,5352.4800000000005,5354.4800000000005,6,Elon
1256, creating vector space,5355.280000000001,5357.280000000001,5,Elon
1257, uh so,5357.280000000001,5359.280000000001,4,Elon
1258," There is a some fundamental like leap that really deserves the 11. I mean, that's a pretty cool number. Yeah, you know",5359.679999999999,5365.599999999999,29,Elon
1259, 11 would be uh a single stack for all you know one stack to rule them all um and uh,5367.2,5374.24,22,Elon
1260, But there they're just some really fundamental uh,5376.32,5379.28,11,Elon
1261, Neural net architecture changes that that are that that will allow for,5380.48,5384.96,15,Elon
1262, uh,5385.92,5386.72,3,Elon
1263," Much more capability, but but you know at first they're gonna have issues so like we have this working on like sort of alpha software and it's good but it's uh",5386.72,5396.08,37,Elon
1264, It's basically taking a whole bunch of cc++ code and and and leading a massive amount of c++ code and replacing it with the neural net and you know,5398.4800000000005,5407.04,35,Elon
1265, Andrei makes this point a lot which is like neural net's a kind of eating software,5407.04,5411.28,20,Elon
1266, You know over time there's like,5412.16,5414.16,9,Elon
1267," Less and less conventional software more and more neural net. We were just a software, but it's you know",5414.16,5418.96,24,Elon
1268," Still comes out to line software, but uh let's it's more more neural net stuff unless uh",5419.679999999999,5426.48,22,Elon
1269, You know hewrest x basically um,5428.16,5430.16,10,Elon
1270, If you're more more more matrix-based stuff unless uh hewrestx-based stuff um,5431.44,5440.48,22,Elon
1271, and um,5441.679999999999,5443.28,4,Elon
1272, You know like like like one of the big changes will be um,5446.4,5450.16,15,Elon
1273, Like right now the neural nets uh will,5451.84,5454.8,10,Elon
1274, um,5456.48,5457.679999999999,3,Elon
1275, Deliver a giant bag of points,5457.679999999999,5460.32,9,Elon
1276, Uh to the c++ or cnc++ code um,5460.8,5464.8,14,Elon
1277, We call it the giant bag of points,5465.679999999999,5467.679999999999,10,Elon
1278, And it's like so you go to pixel and and and and,5468.16,5470.72,15,Elon
1279, Something associated with that pixel like this pixel is probably car that was pixel is probably lane line,5471.4400000000005,5476.72,20,Elon
1280, um then you've got to assemble this giant bag of points in the ccode and turn it into uh vectors,5477.200000000001,5484.16,24,Elon
1281, um,5485.200000000001,5486.72,3,Elon
1282," And uh does a pretty good job of it, but it's uh it's",5487.04,5491.280000000001,18,Elon
1283, We want to just we need another layer of neural net on top of that to take the the giant bag of points,5492.0,5497.6,25,Elon
1284, and distill that down to,5498.64,5500.64,7,Elon
1285, vector space in the in the neural net part of the software as opposed to the hewrestx part of the software,5501.360000000001,5507.84,26,Elon
1286, This is a big improvement um you know and that's all the way down. So you want it's not even your only neural net,5508.64,5514.72,29,Elon
1287, but it's it's uh this will be just a get this is a game changer to not have the bag of points,5515.200000000001,5520.88,26,Elon
1288, The giant bag of points that has to be assembled with uh many lines of cc++ uh and and have the,5521.36,5528.56,25,Elon
1289, And have a neural net just assemble those into vectors. So so the the the neural net is outputting,5529.36,5534.96,23,Elon
1290, um,5536.08,5537.68,3,Elon
1291, Much much less data. It's it's it's outputting this this is a lane line. This is a curb. This is drivable space. This is a card. This is uh,5537.68,5545.12,41,Elon
1292," uh, you know",5545.92,5547.28,6,Elon
1293, Pedestrian or cyclist or something like that. It's outputting,5547.28,5549.92,17,Elon
1294, um,5550.64,5552.16,3,Elon
1295, It's really out outputting um,5552.16,5554.64,9,Elon
1296, prop proper vectors to the,5554.64,5556.64,7,Elon
1297, the cc++ control control code as opposed to,5557.52,5560.4800000000005,12,Elon
1298, the sort of,5562.16,5564.4,5,Elon
1299, constructing the the vectors,5564.4,5566.96,6,Elon
1300, uh in in c um,5566.96,5569.36,7,Elon
1301, We've done i think quite a good job of but it's it's a it we've kind of hitting a local maximum on the how well the c can do this um,5570.4800000000005,5578.8,37,Elon
1302, So this is this is really this is really a big deal and and just all of the networks in the car need need to move to surround video,5579.68,5586.64,31,Elon
1303, This is some legacy networks that are not uh surround video um,5586.72,5590.96,14,Elon
1304, At all of the training needs to move to surround video and the efficiency of the training uh it needs to get better and it is,5592.08,5598.16,28,Elon
1305, And then we need to move everything to uh,5598.8,5600.96,11,Elon
1306, raw,5601.92,5603.92,3,Elon
1307, photon,5603.92,5605.12,3,Elon
1308, counts as opposed to um,5605.12,5607.12,7,Elon
1309," processed images. Yeah, so it's just quite a big reset on the training because the system is trained on",5607.5199999999995,5612.8,24,Elon
1310, post processed image images,5613.28,5615.2,6,Elon
1311, So we need to redo all the training uh,5615.2,5617.599999999999,11,Elon
1312, To train against the the raw photon counts instead of the post processed image,5618.32,5623.5199999999995,16,Elon
1313, So ultimately it's kind of reducing the complexity of the whole thing. So uh,5623.92,5628.32,18,Elon
1314," reducing reducing the lines of code will actually go go lower. Yeah, that's fascinating",5628.4,5632.96,19,Elon
1315, um,5633.68,5634.4,3,Elon
1316, So you're doing fusion of all the sensors so reducing the complexity of having to deal with each of the cameras as,5634.4,5638.879999999999,25,Elon
1317, like cameras really right. Yes,5639.44,5641.44,8,Elon
1318, um,5641.679999999999,5642.96,3,Elon
1319, same with humans,5644.0,5645.36,5,Elon
1320," uh well, I guess we got ears too. Okay. Yeah, well, we'll actually need to incorporate um sound as well",5645.36,5650.639999999999,28,Elon
1321," Because you know, you need to like listen for ambulance siren so far, you know, fire trucks, put you know",5651.2,5656.08,27,Elon
1322, uh if,5656.799999999999,5657.599999999999,4,Elon
1323, If somebody like,5657.599999999999,5659.44,5,Elon
1324, You know yelling at you or something. I don't just that there's that there's a little bit of audio that needs to be incorporated as well,5659.44,5664.24,32,Elon
1325," Do you need to go back to break? Yeah, we listen to sure. Let's take a break. Okay",5664.719999999999,5667.839999999999,25,Elon
1326," Honestly, frankly",5668.879999999999,5670.879999999999,5,Elon
1327, Like the ideas are the easy thing and the implementation is the hot thing like the idea of going to the moon is,5671.04,5676.719999999999,25,Elon
1328, Is the easy part but going to the moon is the hot pot is the hard part um and there's a lot of like hardcore,5676.799999999999,5682.24,28,Elon
1329, ensuring that's going to get done,5682.32,5684.32,9,Elon
1330," At the hardware and software level uh, like sit optimizing the see compiler and uh",5684.48,5689.44,18,Elon
1331, just you know uh,5690.4,5692.639999999999,6,Elon
1332, Kind of out late and see,5692.72,5694.64,8,Elon
1333, Everywhere,5694.64,5695.76,3,Elon
1334, Like this is,5695.76,5697.280000000001,5,Elon
1335," We don't do this assistant if we're not work properly um, so",5697.280000000001,5700.320000000001,17,Elon
1336, The work of the engineers doing this they are like the unsigned heroes to some you know,5701.200000000001,5705.200000000001,20,Elon
1337, But they are critical to the success of the situation. I think you made it clear,5705.6,5710.08,19,Elon
1338, I mean at least to me it's super exciting everything that's going on outside of,5710.08,5712.8,19,Elon
1339," What Andrei's doing? Yeah, just the whole infrastructure the software",5713.52,5716.96,16,Elon
1340, I mean everything is going on with data engine uh whatever whatever it's called,5717.6,5721.12,17,Elon
1341, The whole process is just yeah,5721.76,5723.76,8,Elon
1342, I think we've already missed the sheer scale of it is it's bogus mind like the training at the amount of work done with the like we've written all this,5723.76,5729.92,36,Elon
1343, Custom software for training and labeling,5729.92,5732.32,8,Elon
1344, Um and to do auto labeling auto labeling is essential,5733.28,5736.0,12,Elon
1345, um,5736.88,5738.32,3,Elon
1346, Because especially when you got like surround video,5738.32,5740.16,10,Elon
1347, It's very difficult to like label,5741.12,5742.96,9,Elon
1348, surround video from scratch is extremely difficult um,5743.92,5746.8,10,Elon
1349, Like take a human's such a long time to even label one video clip like several hours,5747.2,5752.64,20,Elon
1350, Uh or the order label it,5753.52,5755.84,8,Elon
1351, Basically we just apply a heavy like heavy duty,5755.84,5758.24,11,Elon
1352, uh,5759.2,5760.56,3,Elon
1353, Like a lot of compute to the to the video clips um,5760.56,5763.360000000001,14,Elon
1354, To pre-assign and guess what all the things are that are going on in the surround video and then there's like correcting it,5764.0,5770.320000000001,29,Elon
1355," Yeah, then the then all the human has to just like tweet like say the you know chant adjust what is incorrect",5770.320000000001,5775.68,25,Elon
1356, This is like,5776.16,5777.52,5,Elon
1357, Increases increases productivity by effect 100 or more,5777.52,5780.8,11,Elon
1358," Yeah, so you've presented test the bot as primarily useful in the factory first of all I think human robots are incredible from a fan of robotics",5781.360000000001,5790.08,31,Elon
1359, I think uh the elusive movement that human,5790.16,5792.88,11,Elon
1360, The human robots that bipedal robots show are just so cool,5793.92,5798.0,15,Elon
1361, So it's uh really interesting that you're working on this and also talking about applying the same kind of,5798.08,5802.72,23,Elon
1362, All the ideas of some of which we've talked about with data engine all the things that we're talking about with test lot of pilot,5803.280000000001,5809.12,29,Elon
1363, Just uh transfer that over to the just yet another robotics problem,5809.6,5813.68,14,Elon
1364, I have to ask since I care about human robot interaction so the human side of that so you've talked about mostly in the factory,5814.56,5821.280000000001,28,Elon
1365, Do you see it?,5821.68,5822.88,7,Elon
1366, Uh also do you see part of this problem that test the bot has to solve is interacting with humans and potentially having a place like in the home,5822.88,5829.52,31,Elon
1367," So interacting majesty sure not replacing labor, but also like",5830.4800000000005,5834.080000000001,13,Elon
1368," I don't know well being a friend or or an assistant. Yeah, I think the the possibilities are",5834.72,5840.240000000001,23,Elon
1369, Yeah endless,5841.52,5843.52,4,Elon
1370," Yeah, I mean it's it's obviously like a it's not quite in tells those",5847.200000000001,5851.120000000001,20,Elon
1371," primary mission direction of accelerating sustainable energy, but",5851.76,5854.72,11,Elon
1372, It is a an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world which is to make a useful humanoid robot,5855.4400000000005,5860.88,25,Elon
1373, um that is capable of,5861.68,5863.68,7,Elon
1374, interacting with the world and,5863.68,5865.68,7,Elon
1375, um,5865.92,5867.4400000000005,3,Elon
1376," Helping in many different ways uh, so",5867.4400000000005,5870.08,11,Elon
1377, So in fact reason and I really just just I mean I think if you say like uh,5871.280000000001,5875.76,20,Elon
1378, Extrapolate to you know many years in the future. It's like I think,5876.72,5880.8,19,Elon
1379, uh work will become optional,5881.76,5883.76,7,Elon
1380, So,5884.96,5886.240000000001,3,Elon
1381, Like there's a lot of jobs that if you're,5886.240000000001,5888.400000000001,13,Elon
1382," If people weren't paid to do it, they they wouldn't do it like it's not it's not fun, you know necessarily like",5889.2,5894.56,30,Elon
1383," If you're washing dishes all day, it's like, uh, you know",5895.2,5897.68,18,Elon
1384," Even if you really like washing dishes, you really want to do it for eight hours a day every day. Probably not so",5898.400000000001,5903.360000000001,27,Elon
1385," Um, and then it's like dangerous work and basically if it's dangerous boring",5905.2,5908.88,18,Elon
1386," Uh, it has like potential for repetitive stress injury that kind of thing um",5909.52,5914.0,17,Elon
1387, Then that's really where,5914.8,5916.56,7,Elon
1388, Humanoid robots would add the most value initially,5916.56,5919.68,11,Elon
1389," Um, so that's what aiming for is is to um",5920.56,5924.64,14,Elon
1390, For the humanoid robots to do jobs that people don't don't voluntarily want to do,5925.92,5930.0,20,Elon
1391," Um, and then that we'll have to pair that obviously with some kind of universal basic basic income in the future",5930.96,5936.16,25,Elon
1392, So I think um,5937.12,5939.360000000001,6,Elon
1393, So do you see a world when there's like hundreds of millions of Tesla bots,5940.08,5944.719999999999,18,Elon
1394, Doing different performing different tasks throughout the world,5946.16,5949.679999999999,10,Elon
1395," Yeah, I haven't really thought about it that far in the future, but I guess that there may be something like that um, so",5952.32,5957.92,30,Elon
1396, Guess a wild question,5960.24,5961.759999999999,6,Elon
1397, So the the number of Tesla cars has been accelerating has been close to two million produced many of them have auto,5961.759999999999,5969.32,24,Elon
1398, Pilot I think we're over two million now. Yeah. Do you think there will ever be a time when there'll be more Tesla bots,5969.44,5975.12,30,Elon
1399, Then Tesla cars,5976.08,5978.08,5,Elon
1400," Yeah, I",5980.719999999999,5982.719999999999,5,Elon
1401, You know actually it's for your subscription because normally I do try to think I'm pretty far into the future,5982.719999999999,5987.2,24,Elon
1402, But I haven't really thought that far into the future,5987.2,5989.2,13,Elon
1403, With the,5989.92,5991.92,4,Elon
1404, Or it's codenade Optimus I call Optimus subprime,5992.5599999999995,5996.719999999999,17,Elon
1405, So it's not so like a giant you know transformer robot,5999.44,6002.639999999999,14,Elon
1406, So,6004.4,6006.4,3,Elon
1407, But it's meant to be a general purpose help help or bot um,6007.04,6010.719999999999,16,Elon
1408, And and basically like like the things that we're basically,6014.719999999999,6017.5199999999995,13,Elon
1409, Like like Tesla I think,6018.48,6020.48,7,Elon
1410, Is the has the most advanced real world AI,6021.44,6024.16,11,Elon
1411, Uh for interacting with the real world which should develop the selection of it to to make self-driving work,6025.04,6029.44,23,Elon
1412," um, and so",6030.24,6032.24,6,Elon
1413, Along with custom hardware and like a lot of you know,6032.24,6036.08,13,Elon
1414, Hardcore low-level software to have it run efficiently and be you know power efficient because you know,6036.88,6041.84,22,Elon
1415," It's one thing to do neural nets if you got a gigantic sober room with 10,000 computers, but now let's say you just you have to now just",6042.24,6048.24,35,Elon
1416, So that down into one computer that's running at low power in a humanoid robot or a car,6048.24,6052.5599999999995,22,Elon
1417," Um, that's actually very difficult and a lot of hardcore software work is required for that um",6053.2,6057.36,22,Elon
1418, So so since we're kind of like solving the navigate the real world,6059.12,6063.92,16,Elon
1419, With neural nets problem for,6065.2,6067.2,7,Elon
1420, Cars which are kind of like robots with four wheels then it's like kind of a natural extension of that is to,6067.599999999999,6072.96,25,Elon
1421, Put it in a robot with arms and legs,6073.76,6075.76,11,Elon
1422, uh,6075.92,6077.92,3,Elon
1423, An actual you know actuators um so,6078.08,6080.72,10,Elon
1424, um,6083.280000000001,6085.280000000001,3,Elon
1425, Like like the the two,6085.280000000001,6087.280000000001,7,Elon
1426, Like hard things are like you basically need to make the,6087.92,6090.64,13,Elon
1427, How the row of being intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way with the environment,6091.52,6095.12,18,Elon
1428, um,6095.92,6097.12,3,Elon
1429, So you need real real world AI and you need to be very good at um,6097.12,6102.16,18,Elon
1430, manufacturing which is a very hard problem tells us very good at manufacturing and also has the real world AI,6102.48,6109.36,22,Elon
1431, So making the humanoid robot work is,6109.44,6111.92,10,Elon
1432, uh basically means developing,6112.639999999999,6114.96,6,Elon
1433, custom,6115.68,6117.68,3,Elon
1434, Motors and sensors,6117.84,6119.84,5,Elon
1435, Uh that that are different for a car would use um,6119.84,6123.36,13,Elon
1436, But we we're also we have a um,6124.16,6126.16,11,Elon
1437, I think we have the the best expertise in,6128.16,6130.5599999999995,11,Elon
1438, Developing advanced electric motors and power electronics. So,6131.4400000000005,6135.4400000000005,12,Elon
1439, It just has to be for,6136.400000000001,6138.400000000001,8,Elon
1440, humanoid robot application or a car,6138.400000000001,6140.400000000001,9,Elon
1441, Still you do talk about love sometimes,6142.240000000001,6144.88,9,Elon
1442, So let me ask this isn't like for like sex robots or something like that. I love it's the answer,6145.68,6149.84,25,Elon
1443, yes,6150.88,6152.080000000001,3,Elon
1444, uh,6152.080000000001,6153.360000000001,3,Elon
1445, There is something compelling,6153.360000000001,6155.200000000001,6,Elon
1446, To us not compelling but we connect with um,6155.200000000001,6158.64,11,Elon
1447, humanoid robots or even like a robot like with the dog and shapes the dogs,6158.72,6162.56,18,Elon
1448," It just it seems like you know, there's a huge amount of loneliness in this world",6163.200000000001,6167.6,20,Elon
1449, All of us seek companionship and with other humans friendship and all those kinds of things,6168.240000000001,6172.320000000001,19,Elon
1450, We have a lot of here in Austin a lot of people have dogs,6172.72,6175.200000000001,16,Elon
1451, So um there seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease,6175.92,6180.88,17,Elon
1452, the uh,6181.92,6183.92,4,Elon
1453, The amount of loneliness in the world or help us humans connect with each other,6183.92,6188.56,17,Elon
1454, So in the way the dogs can,6188.8,6191.360000000001,9,Elon
1455," Um, do you think about that? Would test about it all or is it really focused on the problem of",6192.160000000001,6197.04,24,Elon
1456, of performing specific tasks not connecting with humans?,6197.76,6200.88,11,Elon
1457, um,6201.92,6203.4400000000005,3,Elon
1458," I mean to be honest, I have not actually thought about it from the companion chip standpoint",6203.4400000000005,6207.76,20,Elon
1459, But I think it actually would end up being it could be actually a very good companion,6207.76,6212.08,19,Elon
1460, um,6212.88,6214.400000000001,3,Elon
1461, And it could,6214.4,6216.4,5,Elon
1462, I it you develop like a personality,6216.4,6218.639999999999,9,Elon
1463, uh,6220.08,6221.36,3,Elon
1464," Over time that is that is like unique like uh, you know, it's not like they're just all the robots are the same and that personality could evolve",6221.36,6229.04,34,Elon
1465, to be you know,6229.759999999999,6231.759999999999,6,Elon
1466," Match the the the owner or the you know, I guess",6233.44,6237.5199999999995,14,Elon
1467, The owner uh well,6238.32,6240.32,6,Elon
1468, I want if you want to call it uh the other companion the other half right,6240.32,6244.0,18,Elon
1469," The same way the friends do see I think that's a huge opportunity. I think yeah, no, that's interesting like um",6245.28,6251.839999999999,28,Elon
1470, The because you know like there's a japanese phrasal like the,6253.839999999999,6257.92,16,Elon
1471," Wabi Sabi, you know, uh the subtle imperfections or what makes something special",6258.879999999999,6263.36,20,Elon
1472, And the subtle imperfections of the personality the robot,6264.16,6267.36,12,Elon
1473, mapped to the subtle imperfections of the robot's human,6268.08,6271.44,13,Elon
1474, And,6272.08,6274.08,3,Elon
1475, Friend don't know owner sounds like maybe the wrong word but um,6274.08,6276.639999999999,15,Elon
1476, Could actually make an incredible buddy basically and in that way the imperfections or like a see through pio sort of thing,6279.36,6286.16,26,Elon
1477, You know so from a machine learning perspective,6286.16,6288.24,10,Elon
1478, I think the flaws being a feature is really nice. You could be quite terrible at being a robot for quite a while,6289.919999999999,6296.879999999999,26,Elon
1479, In the general home environment or all the in general world and that's kind of adorable,6297.4400000000005,6302.64,19,Elon
1480, And that's like those are your flaws and you fall in love with those flaws,6302.72,6306.4800000000005,18,Elon
1481, So it's it's a very different than autonomous driving where it's a very high-stakes environment you cannot mess up,6306.8,6312.64,27,Elon
1482," And so it's yeah, it's more fun to be a robot in the home",6313.2,6316.8,19,Elon
1483," Yeah, in fact if you think of like see through pio and",6317.76,6319.84,16,Elon
1484, R2D2 yeah like they actually had a lot of like flaws and imperfections and silly things and,6320.56,6325.68,23,Elon
1485, They would argue with each other,6325.76,6327.76,8,Elon
1486," And um, were they actually good at doing anything?",6328.64,6331.04,13,Elon
1487, Exactly sure. I definitely added a lot to the story,6332.240000000001,6335.6,13,Elon
1488, um,6336.08,6337.280000000001,3,Elon
1489, But but but there's there's sort of quirky elements and,6338.320000000001,6340.72,14,Elon
1490, You know,6342.0,6343.12,4,Elon
1491, That they would like make mistakes and do you think it like it was like uh it made them,6343.12,6347.200000000001,21,Elon
1492," relatable, I don't know um",6348.64,6350.88,9,Elon
1493, Enduring,6350.88,6352.320000000001,4,Elon
1494," So so yeah, I think that that could be something that probably would happen um",6352.4,6357.5199999999995,18,Elon
1495, But our initial focus is just to make it useful,6358.96,6361.599999999999,12,Elon
1496, so,6362.639999999999,6364.24,3,Elon
1497, um,6364.32,6365.679999999999,3,Elon
1498, I'm confident we'll get it done. I'm not sure what the exact time frame is but uh,6365.679999999999,6368.48,23,Elon
1499, Like we'll probably have I don't know a decent prototype,6369.36,6372.16,14,Elon
1500, Towards the end of next year or something like that,6372.88,6374.88,12,Elon
1501, And it's cool that it's connected to Tesla the car,6375.5199999999995,6378.5599999999995,14,Elon
1502," This so so yeah, it's it's using a lot of you know, it would use the autopilot inference computer and",6379.360000000001,6385.4400000000005,27,Elon
1503, Um a lot of the training that we've done for the for cars in terms of recognizing,6386.0,6390.56,20,Elon
1504, Real world things could be applied directly to the,6391.280000000001,6393.84,11,Elon
1505, To the robot um,6394.96,6396.96,6,Elon
1506, So it but but there's there's a lot of custom actuators and sensors that need to be developed,6397.4400000000005,6401.52,23,Elon
1507, And an extra module on top of the vector space for love,6402.56,6406.240000000001,14,Elon
1508," Oh, yeah, that's me",6407.04,6409.04,9,Elon
1509," Okay, we're going back to the car too",6410.639999999999,6412.639999999999,12,Elon
1510, That's true um,6413.28,6415.28,6,Elon
1511, That could be useful in all environments like you said a lot of people argue in the car so maybe we can help them out,6415.599999999999,6420.639999999999,27,Elon
1512," Uh your student of history fan of Dan Carlin's hardcore history podcast. Yeah, it's great greatest podcast ever",6421.84,6427.92,25,Elon
1513," Yeah, I think it probably it's actually",6428.5599999999995,6430.5599999999995,11,Elon
1514," I know it doesn't it almost doesn't really count as a podcast. Yeah, it's so good. It's more like a audiobook",6431.04,6436.16,30,Elon
1515," Yeah, so you were on the podcast with dad just had a chat with him about it",6436.4,6440.0,20,Elon
1516," He said you guys want military and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, it's certainly it was basically um",6440.96,6446.32,24,Elon
1517, Uh,6448.08,6449.28,3,Elon
1518, It should be titled engineer wars uh essentially like like when there's a rapid change in the rate of technology then,6449.28,6456.88,24,Elon
1519, Engineering plays a pivotal role in in victory and battle um,6458.24,6462.48,13,Elon
1520, Do you get how far back in history did you go to go over to uh it was mostly more well,6463.44,6468.639999999999,23,Elon
1521, It was supposed to be a deep dive on fighters and bomber,6468.959999999999,6472.4,14,Elon
1522," Technology in world war two, but then ended up being more wide-ranging than that um",6473.44,6477.919999999999,21,Elon
1523, Because I just went down the atola rathole of like,6478.5599999999995,6480.799999999999,15,Elon
1524, studying all of the the fighters and bombers of world war two and like the constant rock paper says this game that like you know,6481.839999999999,6488.639999999999,27,Elon
1525, Uh one country make this plan that I make it to plan to beat that and that,6489.36,6492.4,19,Elon
1526, But I may claim to be that and then the,6492.639999999999,6494.639999999999,12,Elon
1527, And really what matters like the pace of innovation um and also access to high quality uh fuel and uh roamed turtles,6495.5199999999995,6503.839999999999,25,Elon
1528," So like journey had like some amazing designs, but they couldn't make them uh because they couldn't get their uh roamed turtles uh and",6504.879999999999,6511.919999999999,30,Elon
1529, They had a real problem with the oil and and uh fuel basically the fuel quality was extremely variable,6512.799999999999,6519.759999999999,21,Elon
1530," So the design wasn't the bottleneck is uh, yeah like the US head kickass fuel uh that was like very",6519.92,6525.84,26,Elon
1531, Consistent like the problem is if you make a very high performance aircraft engine,6526.320000000001,6529.52,17,Elon
1532, Um in order to make high performance you have to um,6530.16,6532.64,13,Elon
1533, the the,6533.360000000001,6534.56,4,Elon
1534, The fuel the aviation gas uh has to be a consistent mixture and uh,6536.64,6542.320000000001,16,Elon
1535, It has to have a high octane,6543.6,6545.6,10,Elon
1536, um,6545.84,6547.04,3,Elon
1537," But like high octane is the most important thing, but also can't have like impurities and stuff",6547.04,6550.96,23,Elon
1538, Uh because you'll you'll fall up the engine,6551.5199999999995,6553.12,12,Elon
1539, And and and German just never had good access oil like they tried to get it by invading the cocosis,6554.08,6558.08,25,Elon
1540," Um, but that didn't work too well",6558.72,6560.72,11,Elon
1541, That never works well,6561.84,6563.84,6,Elon
1542," Uh, yeah, yeah",6563.84,6565.84,7,Elon
1543, That's that's for you,6566.32,6567.5199999999995,8,Elon
1544, So there always was journey was always struggling with with basically shitty oil um as then they could not,6567.6,6572.24,21,Elon
1545," uh, they they couldn't count on a on high quality fuel for their aircraft",6572.72,6576.72,18,Elon
1546," So then they had to add all the heavily additives and and stuff uh, so um",6577.12,6581.84,20,Elon
1547," Uh, where it was the US had awesome fuel um and that provided that to Britain as well um so",6583.28,6588.48,23,Elon
1548, That allowed the British and the Americans to design aircraft engines that were,6589.2,6593.5199999999995,15,Elon
1549, Super high performance better than anything else in the world,6594.16,6596.16,12,Elon
1550, And German Germany could could could design the engines to just didn't have the fuel uh and then also the what likes that the,6597.92,6602.96,27,Elon
1551, Uh the quality of the aluminum allies that they were getting was also not that great,6603.92,6606.96,18,Elon
1552," And so yeah, is this like uh do you talk about all this with Dan? Yeah, awesome",6607.68,6612.32,22,Elon
1553, broadly looking at history when you look at jengus con when you look at,6613.68,6617.6,18,Elon
1554, Stalin Hitler the darkest moments of human history,6617.92,6621.04,10,Elon
1555," Uh, what do you take away from those moments does it help you gain insight about human nature about human behavior today",6622.24,6627.2,25,Elon
1556, Whether it's the wars or the individuals or just the behavior of people and the aspects of history,6628.32,6633.36,21,Elon
1557," Yeah, I find history fascinating um",6637.12,6644.08,9,Elon
1558, Um,6644.08,6646.08,3,Elon
1559, I'm just a lot of incredible things that have been done good and bad um that they,6649.6,6654.64,20,Elon
1560, help you just help you understand the nature of,6656.96,6659.84,11,Elon
1561, civilization um,6660.88,6662.88,4,Elon
1562, and individuals and,6663.52,6665.52,5,Elon
1563, Does it make you sad that humans do these kinds of things to each other you look at the 20th century world war two,6666.24,6672.08,27,Elon
1564, The cruelty the abuse of power,6673.28,6675.28,8,Elon
1565, talk about,6675.76,6677.28,4,Elon
1566, communism Marxism and Stalin um i mean some of these things do i mean if you,6677.28,6682.400000000001,19,Elon
1567," Like there's a lot of human history um, but most of it is actually people just getting on with their lives",6683.28,6688.08,25,Elon
1568," uh, you know and and it's not like",6688.400000000001,6689.84,12,Elon
1569, human history is just,6690.72,6692.72,6,Elon
1570, what nonstop war and,6693.12,6695.12,7,Elon
1571, Disaster is that those are actually just those are intermittent and rare and if they weren't then,6695.12,6699.84,21,Elon
1572, The you know humans would soon cease to exist um,6700.56,6703.92,12,Elon
1573," Uh, but it's just that wars tend to be written about a lot and whereas like uh",6706.56,6711.6,21,Elon
1574, Something being like will a no normal year where nothing major happened was just getting ridden about much but that's,6713.52,6718.88,24,Elon
1575, You know most people just like farming and,6719.68,6721.28,10,Elon
1576," Kind of like living their life, you know um being a belliger. It's somewhere",6722.0,6726.400000000001,20,Elon
1577, um,6727.04,6728.24,3,Elon
1578, And every now and again there's a war and i think so um,6729.12,6732.16,16,Elon
1579, And um you know what i have to say like,6736.0,6738.0,12,Elon
1580, The,6738.8,6739.76,3,Elon
1581, There aren't very many books that i where i just had to stop reading because it was just too,6739.76,6743.76,22,Elon
1582, too dark,6744.56,6745.92,4,Elon
1583, but,6745.92,6747.28,3,Elon
1584, The book about Stalin the quarter of the reds are,6747.36,6749.5199999999995,13,Elon
1585, I had could I had to start reading it was just too too bad or dark,6750.8,6755.04,18,Elon
1586, rough,6755.92,6757.36,3,Elon
1587, yeah,6757.36,6759.36,3,Elon
1588, The thirties,6759.44,6761.44,6,Elon
1589, There's a lot a lot of lessons there to me it in particular that it feels like,6761.759999999999,6766.5599999999995,20,Elon
1590, Humans like all of us have that as the old soldier needs in line,6767.599999999999,6771.44,16,Elon
1591, um,6772.48,6773.44,3,Elon
1592, That the line between good and evil runs to the hard-never man that all of us are capable of evil all of us are capable of good,6773.44,6779.36,32,Elon
1593, It's almost like this kind of responsibility that um all of us have to to,6779.36,6784.719999999999,18,Elon
1594, To tend towards the good and so like to me looking at history is almost like an example of,6785.759999999999,6790.879999999999,21,Elon
1595, look you have some charismatic leader,6791.44,6793.44,8,Elon
1596, that uh,6794.16,6795.36,4,Elon
1597, Convinces you of things is too easy,6795.36,6797.36,11,Elon
1598, Based on that story to do evil onto each other onto your family and other others,6798.4,6802.879999999999,18,Elon
1599, And so it's like our responsibility to do good,6803.44,6805.44,12,Elon
1600, It's not like now is somehow different from history that can happen again all of it can happen again,6806.719999999999,6811.839999999999,22,Elon
1601, And yes most of the time you're right i mean the optimistic view here is,6812.879999999999,6816.639999999999,18,Elon
1602, Mostly people are just living life and as you've often meamed about,6817.2,6821.04,16,Elon
1603, The quality of life was way worse back in the day and keeps improving over time through innovation to technology,6822.0,6828.32,22,Elon
1604, But still it's somehow notable that these,6828.799999999999,6830.799999999999,10,Elon
1605, blimps of,6831.599999999999,6833.04,6,Elon
1606, Atrocities happen sure,6833.04,6834.64,7,Elon
1607," Yeah, I mean life was really tough",6836.56,6838.4,10,Elon
1608, Most of history um i mean really for most of human history,6840.48,6843.84,14,Elon
1609, um,6844.8,6845.76,3,Elon
1610, A good year would be one where not that many people in your village,6845.76,6849.84,16,Elon
1611, died of the plague,6850.4,6851.68,6,Elon
1612, Stovation,6851.68,6852.8,5,Elon
1613, Freezing to death or being killed by a neighboring village,6852.8,6855.28,13,Elon
1614, It's like well it wasn't that bad you know was only like you know we lost five percent this year that's,6856.56,6860.4,26,Elon
1615," Yeah, it was good here. You know that would be proper the course",6860.879999999999,6864.32,17,Elon
1616, Like just just not starving to death would have been like the primary goal of most people in through it throughout history,6865.04,6870.879999999999,24,Elon
1617, Is making sure we'll have enough foods last with the winter and not get in our trees or whatever,6871.12,6875.2,22,Elon
1618, so,6875.92,6877.92,3,Elon
1619, um,6878.799999999999,6880.08,3,Elon
1620, Now food is is plan a full we have an obesity problem,6880.08,6883.28,14,Elon
1621, You know so,6884.5599999999995,6886.16,5,Elon
1622," Well, yeah the lesson there is to be grateful for the way things are now for for some of us",6886.16,6891.28,23,Elon
1623, We've spoken about the soft line,6893.04,6895.04,9,Elon
1624, I'd love to get your thought about it here,6895.92,6898.24,12,Elon
1625, If I sat down for a long form in-person conversation with the president of Russia Vladimir Putin,6900.0,6906.16,21,Elon
1626, Would you potentially want to call in for a few minutes,6907.04,6909.5199999999995,13,Elon
1627, Uh to join in on a conversation with him moderated and translated by me,6910.32,6914.24,17,Elon
1628," Sure, yeah, sure I'd be happy to do that",6915.2,6917.2,14,Elon
1629, You've shown interest in the Russian language is this grounded in your interest in history of linguistics culture,6919.599999999999,6925.28,22,Elon
1630, General curiosity I think it sounds cool,6926.24,6928.639999999999,9,Elon
1631, Sounds cool and that looks cool so,6929.76,6931.76,9,Elon
1632," Well, it's you know, it's it's a",6932.5599999999995,6934.8,14,Elon
1633, It takes a moment to read Cyrillic,6935.92,6937.92,11,Elon
1634, um,6938.719999999999,6939.76,3,Elon
1635, What once you know what the Cyrillic,6939.76,6941.76,11,Elon
1636, Character is stand for actually then reading Russian becomes a lot easier because there are a lot of words that are actually the same like bank is bank,6941.76,6950.16,30,Elon
1637, And uh,6954.0,6955.6,4,Elon
1638, So find the words they exactly the same and now you start to understand Cyrillic,6955.6,6959.280000000001,19,Elon
1639," Yeah, if you can if you can sound it out",6959.280000000001,6961.4400000000005,13,Elon
1640, Uh,6962.16,6963.12,3,Elon
1641, The it's much this at least some commonality of words. What about the culture,6963.12,6967.52,19,Elon
1642, You uh you love great engineering physics. There's a tradition of the sciences there. Sure. We look at the 20th century from rocketry,6968.320000000001,6976.88,31,Elon
1643, So you know some of the greatest rockets of the space exploration has been done in the Soviet and the former Soviet Union,6976.88,6983.52,25,Elon
1644," Yeah, so do you draw inspiration from",6983.68,6985.68,10,Elon
1645, That history just how this culture that in many ways I mean one of the sad things is because of the language,6986.4800000000005,6992.56,24,Elon
1646, A lot of it is lost to history because it's not translated to all those kinds of because it it is in some ways an isolated culture,6993.120000000001,7000.400000000001,30,Elon
1647, It flourishes within is within is borders,7000.72,7003.200000000001,10,Elon
1648," Yeah, so do you draw inspiration from those folks from from the history of yeah science engineering there",7004.56,7010.8,21,Elon
1649, I mean the Soviet Union Russia and uh,7011.52,7013.92,10,Elon
1650, Ukraine as well and,7015.04,7017.04,6,Elon
1651, Have a really strong history in space flight like some of the most advanced and impressive things in history were done,7018.0,7025.36,23,Elon
1652, You know by the server-gunian um so,7026.8,7031.5199999999995,13,Elon
1653, Um,7033.5199999999995,7034.88,3,Elon
1654, One can cannot help but admire the impressive rocket technology that was developed,7034.88,7039.5199999999995,15,Elon
1655, um,7040.24,7042.24,3,Elon
1656, You know after the so full of the Soviet Union the,7042.24,7044.24,13,Elon
1657, There there's,7044.8,7046.24,5,Elon
1658, The there's much less that that that happened um,7046.24,7049.84,12,Elon
1659, but uh,7050.88,7052.88,4,Elon
1660, Still things are happening but it's not not quite at the,7053.44,7056.24,14,Elon
1661, frenetic pace that was happening,7057.28,7059.28,8,Elon
1662, uh,7059.28,7060.96,3,Elon
1663, Before the Soviet Union kind of,7060.96,7062.96,8,Elon
1664, It dissolved into separate to reflux,7063.92,7065.92,10,Elon
1665," Yeah, I mean, I you know there's Roskotsk most of Russian the agency. I um",7067.04,7072.0,24,Elon
1666, I look forward to a time when those countries with China working together,7072.96,7077.04,15,Elon
1667," Uh, you in the United States they're all working together. Maybe a little bit of friendly competition, but like friendly competition is good um",7077.6,7083.68,30,Elon
1668," You know, you got a government so slow and the only thing slower than one government is a collection of governments",7084.88,7088.72,24,Elon
1669," So yeah the Olympics would be boring if everyone just crossed the finishing line at the same time. Yeah, nobody would watch",7091.04,7097.6,26,Elon
1670, Yeah,7097.92,7098.96,3,Elon
1671, And and who wouldn't try hard to run fast and stuff. So I think friendly competition is good thing,7099.12,7104.56,23,Elon
1672," Uh, this is also a good place to give a shout out to a video title the entire Soviet rocket engine family tree by Tim Dodd",7106.4,7112.16,30,Elon
1673, aka everyday astronaut. It's like an hour and a half. It gives a full history of uh Soviet rockets,7112.4800000000005,7117.92,24,Elon
1674, And people should definitely go check out and support him in general that guy is super excited about the future,7118.64,7123.84,22,Elon
1675, Super excited about space flight every time I see anything by I might just have a stupid smile on my face,7123.92,7128.88,23,Elon
1676," Because he's so excited about stuff. Yeah, Tim Dodd is a really really great. If you're interested in anything to do a space",7128.96,7135.36,31,Elon
1677, He's in terms of explaining rocket technology to your average person. He's awesome the best I'd say,7136.32,7143.04,23,Elon
1678, And um I should say like the,7145.04,7147.12,9,Elon
1679," Part of reason like uh, I switched us from",7147.92,7150.72,12,Elon
1680, Like we're after at one point. There's gonna be a hydrogen engine,7152.0,7154.0,17,Elon
1681, um,7154.56,7156.0,3,Elon
1682, But hydrogen has a lot of challenges. It's very low density. It's a deep cryogen. So it's only liquid at a very,7156.08,7160.88,31,Elon
1683, You're very close to absolute zero,7161.44,7163.44,9,Elon
1684, requires a lot of insulation. It's um,7163.44,7165.44,11,Elon
1685, So it is a lot of a lot of challenges there,7166.72,7168.72,13,Elon
1686, um and um,7169.92,7171.92,5,Elon
1687, And I was actually reading a bit about uh Russian rocket engine development and um,7171.92,7176.88,17,Elon
1688, At least the impression I had was that that uh or so it was so a junior Russia and Ukraine uh primarily were,7177.6,7184.0,25,Elon
1689, uh actually in the process of,7184.8,7186.8,8,Elon
1690, uh switching to methalox,7187.52,7189.52,8,Elon
1691, um and there was some interesting test and data for,7190.4,7193.92,12,Elon
1692, ISP like they were able to get like,7194.56,7196.56,11,Elon
1693, up to like a three hundred eighty second ISP with uh,7197.2,7199.92,14,Elon
1694," Metalox engine and I was like well, okay, that's",7200.4,7202.4,15,Elon
1695, That's actually really impressive. So,7203.68,7205.68,9,Elon
1696, um,7207.04,7208.8,3,Elon
1697, So I think we could you could actually get,7208.8,7210.8,11,Elon
1698, Is um and much lower cost like in optimizing cost pretend to over at cost pretend to Mars um,7211.6,7217.68,21,Elon
1699," It's uh, I think",7218.8,7220.8,8,Elon
1700, um,7221.28,7222.72,3,Elon
1701, Methane oxygen is the way to go um and I was partly inspired by the Russian work on the test ends uh,7222.72,7229.12,25,Elon
1702, With methalox engines,7230.24,7232.24,7,Elon
1703, And now for something completely different,7232.64,7234.64,8,Elon
1704, Do you mind doing a uh a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great the powerful beauty pie,7235.360000000001,7240.8,24,Elon
1705, Let's say one to eleven just go over a few documents printed out,7241.68,7244.8,16,Elon
1706, We can try let's try this,7245.6,7247.6,9,Elon
1707, I present to you document number uno,7249.68,7252.400000000001,9,Elon
1708, I don't know okay,7256.4800000000005,7258.88,7,Elon
1709, Flat-dane paler discovers marshmallows,7258.96,7262.08,11,Elon
1710, That's not bad,7264.08,7266.08,6,Elon
1711, So,7267.2,7269.2,3,Elon
1712," Get it because uh yes, I got you're failing things",7269.2,7271.68,14,Elon
1713," Yes, I got it. I don't know three but uh that's not very good",7271.68,7275.52,20,Elon
1714, This is um ground in some engineering some history,7279.28,7283.28,11,Elon
1715, Uh,7283.44,7285.44,3,Elon
1716," Ha ha yeah, give us an eight out of ten",7287.44,7290.08,13,Elon
1717, What do you think about nuclear power? I'm in favor of nuclear power. I think it's uh,7291.2,7295.759999999999,23,Elon
1718, I in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters. I think it's a nuclear power is a great way to generate,7297.679999999999,7305.04,28,Elon
1719, electricity,7305.759999999999,7307.599999999999,3,Elon
1720," Um, I don't I don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations",7307.599999999999,7310.48,19,Elon
1721," Yeah, but what about your novel",7310.5599999999995,7313.04,9,Elon
1722, exactly,7314.32,7316.32,3,Elon
1723, So,7317.28,7318.799999999999,3,Elon
1724," Uh, I think people that there's like a lot of fear of radiation and stuff um",7318.799999999999,7322.799999999999,20,Elon
1725, And it's I guess what probably is like a lot of people just don't,7324.32,7327.599999999999,18,Elon
1726, Understood I'd even study,7328.4,7330.24,7,Elon
1727," Engineering or physics so they're not it's who is the word radiation just sounds scary, you know",7331.2,7335.839999999999,22,Elon
1728, So they don't they can't calibrate what radiation means,7335.839999999999,7338.879999999999,14,Elon
1729, um,7339.68,7340.96,3,Elon
1730, But radiation is much less dangerous than than than you think um,7340.96,7345.28,14,Elon
1731, So um,7346.88,7348.88,4,Elon
1732," Like for example Fukushima, you know um",7350.32,7353.12,11,Elon
1733, When the Fukushima problem happened,7354.32,7356.32,8,Elon
1734, To the tsunami the,7358.56,7360.56,6,Elon
1735, I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation,7361.36,7364.88,15,Elon
1736, From Fukushima. I'm like,7365.68,7367.68,9,Elon
1737, definitely not not even slightly not at all,7367.76,7370.64,10,Elon
1738, that is crazy um,7371.52,7373.52,6,Elon
1739, and,7374.16,7375.36,3,Elon
1740, just to,7375.36,7377.36,4,Elon
1741, Show like look this is how,7377.84,7379.84,8,Elon
1742, Like the dangers is so much overplayed compared to what what it really is that I actually flew to Fukushima,7381.84,7388.0,25,Elon
1743, and I actually I donated a,7389.04,7391.04,8,Elon
1744, A solar power system for water treatment plant and uh,7391.84,7396.24,12,Elon
1745, And I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables,7397.28,7401.04,12,Elon
1746, um,7402.08,7403.68,3,Elon
1747, On TV in Fukushima,7403.68,7405.84,7,Elon
1748, Like,7408.72,7409.68,3,Elon
1749, I'm still alive. Okay,7409.68,7411.68,8,Elon
1750, It's not even at the risk of these events as low but the impact of them is,7411.68,7415.6,20,Elon
1751, The impact is greatly exaggerated. It's just great. It's just great. It's human nature,7415.6,7419.44,22,Elon
1752, It's people don't know what radiation is like I've had people ask me like what about radiation from cell phones,7420.08,7424.639999999999,25,Elon
1753, According causing brain cancer. I'm like we say radiation. Do you mean photons or particles?,7424.96,7429.2,21,Elon
1754, than like that I don't know what would you mean photons particles? Do you mean,7429.5199999999995,7432.719999999999,19,Elon
1755, uh,7433.759999999999,7435.44,3,Elon
1756, Let's say photons what what frequency or wavelength and they're like no idea um,7435.44,7441.28,18,Elon
1757, Like do you know that everything's radiating all the time,7441.759999999999,7443.839999999999,14,Elon
1758, Like what do you mean like yeah everything's radiating all the time,7444.799999999999,7447.599999999999,16,Elon
1759, Photons are being emitted by by all objects all the time basically so,7448.56,7452.64,16,Elon
1760, um,7453.52,7454.4800000000005,3,Elon
1761, And she want to know what it's it's what what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire,7454.4800000000005,7459.4400000000005,23,Elon
1762, Go outside,7460.160000000001,7461.68,4,Elon
1763, The Sun is a gigantic,7461.68,7463.200000000001,7,Elon
1764, You know thermonuclear reactor you're staring right at it,7464.400000000001,7467.92,14,Elon
1765," Yeah, I used to live. Yes. Okay. Amazing",7468.64,7470.64,14,Elon
1766," Yeah, I guess radiation is one of the words that could be used as uh as a tool to to to fear monger by certain people",7471.6,7479.6,31,Elon
1767, That's it. I think I'll just don't understand,7479.76,7482.0,14,Elon
1768, So I mean that's the way to fight that uh that fear I suppose just to understand is to learn,7482.0,7486.0,23,Elon
1769," Yeah, just say like okay. How many people have actually died from nuclear accidents? It's like practically nothing and",7486.64,7491.84,25,Elon
1770, Uh say how many people have have died from,7492.56,7494.8,11,Elon
1771, You know coal plants and it's a very big number,7495.6,7498.400000000001,13,Elon
1772, so,7499.36,7500.96,3,Elon
1773, Like obviously we should not be,7500.96,7502.96,8,Elon
1774, starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants just doesn't make any sense at all,7503.2,7507.2,19,Elon
1775, coal plants like I don't know 100 to a thousand times worse for for health and nuclear power plants,7508.32,7513.839999999999,22,Elon
1776," Ah, you want to go to the next one? This is really bad",7514.96,7517.5199999999995,17,Elon
1777, So that uh,7520.24,7522.24,5,Elon

1789, I don't tell you the full story of you know what what the love the impact they had on the loved ones,7578.96,7584.24,25,Elon
1790," Yeah, true that won't get an 11 for me. Sure. So this show uh, yeah, this keeps going",7584.719999999999,7589.679999999999,26,Elon
1791, on the Russian theme,7590.48,7592.48,6,Elon
1792," First man in space nobody cares first man in the moon. Well, I think people do care. No, I know, but um",7593.12,7598.88,29,Elon
1793, I there's your gaga and snails will will will be forever in history. I think there is something special about,7600.4,7606.8,26,Elon
1794, placing like,7607.36,7608.88,4,Elon
1795, stepping foot onto another,7608.96,7610.96,6,Elon
1796, surely foreign land,7610.96,7612.96,5,Elon
1797, It's it's not the journey like uh people that explore the oceans. It's not as important to explore the oceans is to land in a whole new continent,7612.96,7620.96,34,Elon
1798," Yeah, this is about you",7622.56,7624.56,8,Elon
1799," Oh, yeah, I'd love to get your comment on this y'all must",7626.32,7628.64,19,Elon
1800, After sending six point six billion dollars to the UN to end world hunger you have three hours,7629.6,7634.96,20,Elon
1801, um,7636.72,7637.76,3,Elon
1802," You know, I mean obviously six billion dollars darker and will do hunger so",7637.84,7640.72,17,Elon
1803, um,7642.96,7644.16,3,Elon
1804, So,7644.16,7645.360000000001,3,Elon
1805, I mean the reality is at this point the world is producing,7645.360000000001,7647.76,14,Elon
1806, Far more food than it can really consume it like we don't have a caloric uh,7649.360000000001,7654.0,20,Elon
1807, Constraint to this point so where there is hunger it is,7654.96,7657.280000000001,15,Elon
1808, almost always due to um,7658.16,7660.16,7,Elon
1809, It's like like civil war or strife or some like um,7660.8,7664.0,15,Elon
1810, It's it's not a thing that is,7665.12,7667.12,11,Elon
1811, It extremely rare for it to be just a matter of like,7668.56,7671.6,14,Elon
1812, lack of money. It's like,7672.400000000001,7674.400000000001,9,Elon
1813," You know, it's like some",7674.8,7676.08,9,Elon
1814, To the civil war in some some country and then like one part of the country's literally trying to starve the other part of the country um,7676.08,7681.360000000001,30,Elon
1815, So it's much more complex than something that money could solve it's politics. It's,7682.88,7687.52,20,Elon
1816, It's a lot of things. It's human nature. It's governments. It's money's monitor systems all that kind of stuff,7688.16,7694.16,29,Elon
1817," Yeah, food is extremely cheap",7694.639999999999,7696.639999999999,8,Elon
1818, these days. It's like it's,7697.04,7699.04,10,Elon
1819, I mean the US at this point um,7700.8,7702.8,10,Elon
1820, You know among low-income families obesity is actually now the problem. It's not,7703.36,7708.24,19,Elon
1821," Like obviously it's it's not hunger. It's it's like too much you know too many calories. Uh, so",7709.04,7714.8,27,Elon
1822, I said it's not that nobody's hungry anywhere. It's just it's just this is uh,7716.0,7719.68,22,Elon
1823, Not not a simple matter of adding money and solving it,7721.36,7723.68,13,Elon
1824, Hmm,7724.4,7726.4,3,Elon
1825, What do you think that one gets,7726.4,7728.4,9,Elon
1826, this getting,7728.639999999999,7730.639999999999,4,Elon
1827, to,7730.639999999999,7732.639999999999,3,Elon
1828," Just going after empire's world uh, where did you get those artifacts the British Museum",7733.84,7738.4,19,Elon
1829, It shut out to,7739.2,7740.72,6,Elon
1830, Antipython we found them,7740.72,7742.96,9,Elon
1831," Yeah, the rich uh the museum is it's pretty great. I mean yeah",7742.96,7746.5599999999995,18,Elon
1832," It admittedly Britain did take uh these historical artifacts from all around the world and put them in London, but uh",7746.8,7752.08,25,Elon
1833," You know, it it it's not like people can't go see them uh, so it is a it can be in a place to see these",7752.64,7758.64,32,Elon
1834, Ancient artifacts is is London for,7759.04,7761.2,8,Elon
1835, You know for for large segment of the world,7762.16,7764.16,11,Elon
1836, So I think you know on balance the British Museum is a net good,7764.96,7767.92,16,Elon
1837, Although I've showed the lot of countries are all about that. Yeah,7768.96,7771.5199999999995,16,Elon
1838, It's like you want to make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as possible and the British Museum,7772.64,7778.08,23,Elon
1839, I think there's a good job of that,7778.72,7780.72,11,Elon
1840, Even if there's a darker aspect to like the history of empire in general whatever the empire is,7781.2,7785.84,21,Elon
1841, however things were done,7786.56,7788.56,6,Elon
1842, It is the history that happened you can't sort of erase that history unfortunately you could just become better in the future,7790.08,7795.76,25,Elon
1843, It's the point,7796.56,7798.56,6,Elon
1844," Yeah, I mean",7798.56,7800.08,6,Elon
1845," It's like well, how are we gonna pass moral judgment on these these things like it's like if you uh",7800.08,7805.52,25,Elon
1846, You know,7806.96,7808.320000000001,4,Elon
1847, If one is gonna judge say the version empire you got to judge you know,7808.4,7811.599999999999,17,Elon
1848, Whatever one was doing at the time and how were the British relative to everyone,7811.599999999999,7815.84,17,Elon
1849, um,7816.799999999999,7818.08,3,Elon
1850," And I think they were first would actually get like a relatively good grade relatively good grade not an absolute terms, but compared to",7818.08,7825.28,27,Elon
1851, whatever else was doing um,7826.48,7828.48,7,Elon
1852, The they were not the worst like said you gotta look at these things in the context of the history at the time,7829.04,7834.4,25,Elon
1853," And say what were what were the alternatives and what are you comparing it against yes, and I'd I do not think it would be the case that",7835.28,7842.0,32,Elon
1854, Britain would get a,7843.599999999999,7845.599999999999,6,Elon
1855, bad grade in when looking at history at the time,7845.599999999999,7848.48,12,Elon
1856," No, if you judge history from",7848.96,7850.96,9,Elon
1857, You know,7852.08,7853.36,4,Elon
1858," From what is morally acceptable today you're basically gonna give everyone a feeling great. Yeah, I'm not clear",7853.36,7859.36,24,Elon
1859, So I don't think anyone would get a passing grade um in their morality of like you go back 300 years ago,7859.44,7865.92,25,Elon
1860, Like who's getting a passing grade?,7866.4,7868.4,10,Elon
1861, Oh basically no one,7868.4,7870.4,6,Elon
1862, And we might not get a passing grade from generations that uh the comatress,7870.639999999999,7875.5199999999995,18,Elon
1863," Uh, what does that one get uh",7876.88,7878.88,10,Elon
1864," Sure, uh, success seven seven for the mighty python maybe uh, those are mighty python their great",7880.24,7885.5199999999995,22,Elon

1946, Find a fulfilling existence same as humans I suppose,8258.560000000001,8261.84,11,Elon
1947," but um, I wonder if that's like the default if you don't do a good job. I'm building a robot. It's going to be sad a lot",8262.800000000001,8270.800000000001,36,Elon
1948," Well, we can reprogram robots easier than we can reprogram humans",8272.640000000001,8276.4,16,Elon
1949, so,8278.08,8280.08,3,Elon
1950, I guess if you let it evolve without,8280.16,8282.24,10,Elon
1951," Tinkering then it might get to a sad uh, but you can change the optimization function and have it be a cheery robot",8283.039999999999,8290.0,29,Elon
1952," You uh, like I mentioned with with space sacks you give a lot of people hope and a lot of people look up to you millions of people look up to you",8292.88,8299.52,36,Elon
1953, If we think about young people in high school maybe in college,8300.32,8304.32,14,Elon
1954," um, what advice would you give to them about",8305.36,8308.16,12,Elon
1955," If they want to try to do something big in this world, they want to really have a big positive impact",8309.119999999999,8313.52,24,Elon
1956, What advice would you give them about their career maybe about life in general,8313.52,8317.44,16,Elon
1957," Try to be useful um, you know, do things that are useful to your fellow human beings to the world. It's very hard to be useful",8319.28,8327.6,32,Elon
1958, um,8328.4,8330.4,3,Elon
1959, Very hard,8331.119999999999,8332.8,4,Elon
1960," um, you know, are you contributing more than you",8332.8,8335.36,13,Elon
1961," consume, you know, like uh",8336.32,8338.32,9,Elon
1962, Like can you,8339.44,8341.12,5,Elon
1963, Try to have a positive net contribution to society um,8341.92,8345.92,12,Elon
1964, I think that's the thing to aim for you know not not to try to be sort of a leader for,8347.6,8352.0,24,Elon
1965, For the sake of being a leader or whatever um,8353.12,8355.12,12,Elon
1966, A lot of time with people who who you the a lot of time the people you want as leaders are other people who don't want to be leaders,8356.960000000001,8362.960000000001,32,Elon
1967, So,8363.359999999999,8365.359999999999,3,Elon
1968, um,8366.32,8368.32,3,Elon
1969, If you live a useful life,8369.279999999999,8371.279999999999,8,Elon
1970, That is a good life a life worth having lived um,8372.24,8377.439999999999,13,Elon
1971, You know and I'd like to say I would I would encourage people to,8378.4,8381.919999999998,17,Elon
1972, Use the mental tools of physics and apply them broadly in life,8384.0,8387.519999999999,14,Elon
1973, There are the best tools when you think about education and self-education. What do you recommend?,8388.16,8393.36,23,Elon
1974, There's so there's the university there's,8393.76,8395.76,11,Elon
1975, uh self-study,8396.960000000001,8398.960000000001,7,Elon
1976, There is uh hands-on sort of finding a company or a place or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about and joining them as early as possible,8398.960000000001,8407.12,36,Elon
1977, um,8407.92,8408.960000000001,3,Elon
1978, There's uh taking a road trip across Europe for a few years and writing some poetry which uh which which trajectory do you suggest?,8408.960000000001,8416.32,28,Elon
1979, In terms of learning about how you can become useful as you mentioned how you can have the most positive impact,8418.08,8425.04,23,Elon
1980, What I'd encourage people to read a lot of books,8432.560000000001,8434.560000000001,13,Elon
1981, Just read like I mean basically try to ingest as much information as you can,8435.84,8440.640000000001,18,Elon
1982, Uh and try to also just develop a good general knowledge um,8442.48,8446.32,14,Elon
1983, So you so you at least have like a rough lay of the land of the the knowledge landscape,8447.279999999999,8452.88,21,Elon
1984, um like try to learn a little bit about a lot of things,8453.84,8456.8,15,Elon
1985, um because you might not know what you're really interested,8457.76,8459.76,13,Elon
1986, How would you know what you're really interested in if you at least aren't like doing it,8459.76,8463.119999999999,21,Elon
1987, peripheral exploration or broadly of,8463.92,8466.08,7,Elon
1988, of the knowledge landscape,8466.88,8469.279999999999,6,Elon
1989, um,8470.08,8471.36,3,Elon
1990, And you talk to people from different walks of life and different,8472.24,8475.44,14,Elon
1991, industries and professions and skills and actually,8476.8,8480.0,9,Elon
1992, archipagia's like just try to learn as much as possible,8480.0,8484.56,16,Elon
1993, Man's search for a meeting,8487.36,8489.36,8,Elon
1994, Isn't the whole thing a search for meaning?,8490.88,8492.56,12,Elon
1995," Is yeah, what's meeting a life and all you know",8493.76,8496.4,14,Elon
1996, But just generally like I said I would encourage people to read broadly um in many different subject areas um,8497.119999999999,8502.8,22,Elon
1997, and and and then try to find something where there's an overlap of your talents and,8503.759999999998,8510.08,19,Elon
1998, and what you're interested in so people may may be good at something but well they may have skill at a particular thing,8510.64,8516.32,26,Elon
1999, But they don't like doing it,8516.32,8518.32,9,Elon
2000, um,8518.32,8519.439999999999,3,Elon
2001, So you want to try to find a thing where you have your,8519.439999999999,8521.679999999998,15,Elon
2002, That's a good a good,8522.48,8524.16,8,Elon
2003, combination of of your of the things that you're inherently good at but you also like doing,8524.16,8529.599999999999,20,Elon
2004, um,8530.4,8532.4,3,Elon
2005, And reading is a super fast shortcut to to figure out which where are you both good at it you like doing it,8533.279999999999,8540.4,25,Elon
2006, And it will actually have positive impact,8540.8,8542.8,9,Elon
2007," Well, you got to learn about things somehow so reading",8543.199999999999,8545.76,13,Elon
2008, a broad range it's just really,8547.039999999999,8549.199999999999,9,Elon
2009, Read it,8550.16,8551.199999999999,4,Elon
2010, You know one point was that kid I I read through the encyclopedia,8551.199999999999,8555.52,17,Elon
2011, so,8556.32,8557.359999999999,3,Elon
2012, that's pretty helpful um,8557.359999999999,8559.039999999999,7,Elon
2013, and uh,8560.0,8561.52,4,Elon
2014, There's also things that didn't even exist in a whole lot so obviously and,8561.52,8564.48,18,Elon
2015, It's like as broad as it gets,8564.48,8566.0,10,Elon
2016, Encyclopedias were digestible I think uh you know whatever 40 years ago um,8566.0,8571.6,19,Elon
2017, so um,8572.640000000001,8574.640000000001,4,Elon
2018, You know read through the the condensed version of the encyclopedia Britannica I'd recommend that,8575.04,8579.68,22,Elon
2019, um you can always like skip subjects though you read a few paragraphs and you know you're not interested,8580.640000000001,8585.68,22,Elon
2020, Just jump to the next one,8585.68,8587.36,8,Elon
2021, So read the encyclopedia or scan skim skim through it um,8587.44,8592.400000000001,17,Elon
2022, And um,8594.960000000001,8596.960000000001,4,Elon
2023, But I you know put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect for someone who puts in an honest day's work,8597.36,8603.04,28,Elon
2024, to do useful things,8603.76,8605.76,6,Elon
2025, and and just generally to have like a not a zero-sum mindset um or a like have have more of a,8606.0,8613.2,26,Elon
2026, Grow the pie mindset like the,8614.16,8616.16,8,Elon
2027, If you if you sort of say like when we see people like perhaps um including some very smart people,8618.0,8623.84,22,Elon
2028, Kind of taking an attitude of like like like like like doing things that seem like morally questionable,8625.2,8630.16,20,Elon
2029, It's often because they have at at a base sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum mindset,8630.880000000001,8636.320000000002,24,Elon
2030, Um and and they without realizing it they don't realize they have a zero-sum mindset,8637.2,8642.560000000001,21,Elon
2031, Or at least that they don't realize it consciously,8642.96,8644.96,12,Elon
2032," Um, and so if you have a zero-sum mindset then the only way to get ahead is by taking things from others",8645.519999999999,8649.92,28,Elon
2033, But if if it's like if if if the if the if the pie is fixed,8650.96,8654.64,19,Elon
2034, Then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else's pie,8655.119999999999,8658.32,17,Elon
2035, But but this is false like obviously the pie has grown dramatically over time the economic pie,8659.199999999999,8663.439999999999,19,Elon
2036, So the reality you can have the,8664.56,8667.359999999999,9,Elon
2037, uh,8667.52,8669.52,3,Elon
2038, So overuse this analogy we have a lot of you can have this a lot of pie,8669.52,8673.84,20,Elon
2039," Yeah, my pie is not fixed",8675.92,8677.92,9,Elon
2040," uh, so you really want to make sure you don't you know operating",8678.400000000001,8681.6,17,Elon
2041, um without realizing it from a zero-sum mindset,8682.08,8685.04,13,Elon
2042, Where where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others,8685.6,8688.24,16,Elon
2043," Then that's gonna result in you take try to take things from others, which is not not good. It's much better to work on",8688.24,8693.04,30,Elon
2044, uh,8694.08,8695.2,3,Elon
2045," Adding to the economic pie maybe you know, so",8695.2,8697.28,12,Elon
2046, You know creating like said create creating more than you consume,8699.76,8703.84,13,Elon
2047, doing more than you,8704.800000000001,8706.0,6,Elon
2048," Yeah, um",8706.0,8707.6,5,Elon
2049," So that's that's a big deal. Um, I think there's like if you know fair number of people in",8707.76,8711.68,26,Elon
2050, in finance that,8712.800000000001,8714.800000000001,5,Elon
2051, Do you have a bit of a zero-sum mindset?,8714.800000000001,8716.640000000001,15,Elon
2052," I mean, it's all walks of life. I've that seen that one of the one of the reasons",8717.36,8721.44,24,Elon
2053, uh,8722.16,8723.2,3,Elon
2054, Rogan inspires me is he celebrates all there's a lot that is not,8723.2,8727.04,17,Elon
2055, Not creating a constant competition like there's a scarcity of resources,8727.6,8731.04,14,Elon
2056, What happens when you celebrate others? Any promote others?,8731.28,8734.16,13,Elon
2057," The ideas of others it it uh, it actually grows that pie. I mean it to every like the",8734.880000000001,8740.720000000001,23,Elon
2058, The resources the resources become less scarce,8741.52,8744.08,9,Elon
2059, And that that applies in a lot of kinds of domains it applies in academia where a lot of people are very,8744.640000000001,8748.880000000001,24,Elon
2060, See some funding for academic research is zero-sum and it is not if you celebrate each other if you make,8749.839999999998,8755.599999999999,25,Elon
2061, If you get everybody to be excited about AI about physics above mathematics,8756.08,8759.839999999998,15,Elon
2062," I think it there'd be more and more funding and I think everybody wins. Yeah, that applies. I think broadly",8760.32,8765.439999999999,26,Elon
2063," Yeah, yeah, I like that great. So last last question about love and meaning",8766.56,8771.439999999999,19,Elon
2064," Uh, what is the role of love in the human condition broadly and more specific to you?",8773.199999999999,8778.24,21,Elon
2065, How has love romantic love or otherwise made you a better person a better human being,8778.64,8783.84,18,Elon
2066, Better engineer,8787.119999999999,8789.119999999999,4,Elon
2067, Now you're asking really complexing questions,8789.199999999999,8791.199999999999,10,Elon
2068, um,8792.24,8794.24,3,Elon
2069, It's hard to give a,8794.4,8796.4,8,Elon
2070, I mean there were many,8796.88,8798.56,7,Elon
2071, Books poems and songs written about what is love and what is what is exactly you know um,8798.56,8805.68,20,Elon
2072, um,8805.84,8807.84,3,Elon
2073," Yeah, what is love figured out hurt me",8807.84,8809.84,11,Elon
2074," Um, but that's one of the great ones. Yes. Yeah, you've you've earlier quoted Shakespeare, but that that's really up there. Yeah",8811.68,8818.16,34,Elon
2075," I mean, not always a many splendid thing. Uh, I mean there's um it's because we've talked about so many inspiring things",8819.6,8827.36,30,Elon
2076, Like be useful in the world sort of like solve problems,8827.36,8829.92,13,Elon
2077," alleviate suffering, but",8830.56,8832.720000000001,6,Elon
2078, It seems like connection between humans as a source,8832.720000000001,8835.2,11,Elon
2079," You know, it's um",8836.32,8837.92,8,Elon
2080, It's a source of joy is a source of meaning and that that's what love is friendship love,8837.92,8842.24,22,Elon
2081, I just wonder if you think about that kind of thing when you talk about,8844.16,8847.28,17,Elon
2082," Preserving the light of human consciousness, right and us becoming a multiplicity multi-planetary species",8848.48,8854.08,23,Elon
2083, I mean to me at least,8855.28,8857.28,8,Elon
2084, um,8858.0,8859.52,3,Elon
2085, That that means like if we're just alone and conscious and intelligent,8859.68,8863.84,15,Elon
2086, It doesn't mean nearly as much as if we're with others,8864.32,8867.28,15,Elon
2087," Right, and there's some magic created when we're together",8868.16,8871.28,14,Elon
2088, the,8872.08,8873.44,3,Elon
2089, The the French of of it and I think the highest form of it is love which I think broadly is is much bigger than just sort of romantic,8873.44,8880.64,31,Elon
2090, but also yes romantic love and,8881.04,8883.04,8,Elon
2091," Family and those kinds of things. Well, I mean the reason I guess I care about",8884.4,8887.92,20,Elon
2092, That's becoming a multi-planet species and the space-prank civilization is,8888.56,8892.56,19,Elon
2093, foundationally I love humanity,8893.2,8895.2,7,Elon
2094, um and and so I wish to see it prosper and,8896.32,8900.64,13,Elon
2095, Do great things and be happy and,8902.08,8904.08,9,Elon
2096," Um, and if I did not love humanity, I would not care about these things",8905.2,8908.56,19,Elon
2097, So you look at the whole of it the human history all the people has ever lived all the people live now,8911.28,8916.08,24,Elon
2098, It's pretty,8916.72,8918.72,5,Elon
2099, We're okay,8919.039999999999,8921.039999999999,5,Elon
2100, And on the whole we're pretty interesting,8921.52,8923.52,10,Elon
2101, uh bunch,8924.08,8925.28,4,Elon
2102, Yeah,8925.28,8926.64,3,Elon
2103, all things considered,8926.64,8928.24,5,Elon
2104, And I've read a lot of history including the darkest worst parts of it and uh,8928.24,8933.12,19,Elon
2105, It just by all that I think on balance,8934.08,8936.08,11,Elon
2106, I still love humanity,8936.64,8938.64,6,Elon
2107, You joked about it with the 42 uh what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?,8939.44,8944.0,23,Elon
2108," Is it like is there a non-human? Oh, I just like yeah, well really I think what Dr. Sallans was saying in Hitchhack's guy to the galaxy is that",8944.96,8953.6,43,Elon
2109, um,8954.16,8955.76,3,Elon
2110, The universe is the answer and,8955.84,8957.84,8,Elon
2111, uh,8958.96,8960.0,3,Elon
2112, What,8960.0,8960.88,3,Elon
2113, We really need to figure out are what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe? Yeah,8960.88,8965.76,22,Elon
2114," Um, and that the question is the really the hard part and if you can properly frame the question then the answer relatively speaking is easy",8966.4,8972.24,29,Elon
2115, uh,8973.04,8973.84,3,Elon
2116, So,8974.0,8975.28,3,Elon
2117, So therefore if if you want to understand,8975.28,8977.44,10,Elon
2118, What questions to ask about the universe you want to understand the meaning of life we need to,8978.88,8982.8,20,Elon
2119, Expand the scope and scale of consciousness,8983.44,8985.2,10,Elon
2120, So that there were better able to,8985.84,8987.84,9,Elon
2121, Understand the nature of the universe and and understand the meaning of life,8988.32,8991.76,15,Elon
2122, And ultimately the most important part will be to ask the right question,8992.48,8996.48,15,Elon
