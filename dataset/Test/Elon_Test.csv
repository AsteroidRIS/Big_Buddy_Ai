0, I'm still proud of John.,0.0,2.0,9,Elon_test
1, Woo!,2.0,4.0,4,Elon_test
2," You know, I taste like him.",4.0,10.0,10,Elon_test
3," Every time I see that clip, it chills me.",10.0,13.0,13,Elon_test
4, Every single time.,13.0,15.0,6,Elon_test
5, And I look at it a lot.,15.0,19.0,10,Elon_test
6, So thank you very much for coming here.,19.0,21.0,11,Elon_test
7, I know it's not convenient. It's not around the corner.,21.0,23.0,16,Elon_test
8, I'm really appreciative.,23.0,25.0,7,Elon_test
9, Absolutely. Thank you for having me.,25.0,27.0,10,Elon_test
10," I was on a red eye flight, so I'm a little slower than normal.",27.0,31.0,19,Elon_test
11, I didn't get much sleep.,31.0,34.0,9,Elon_test
12, That's sort of my first question.,34.0,37.0,10,Elon_test
13," Is that, so you're 51?",37.0,40.0,10,Elon_test
14, Yeah.,40.0,43.0,4,Elon_test
15, I think I'm safely not a spring chicken anymore.,43.0,47.0,13,Elon_test
16, It's a late summer chicken.,47.0,49.0,9,Elon_test
17, I'm 79.,49.0,52.0,6,Elon_test
18," But just for you, I mean, you look great.",52.0,57.0,14,Elon_test
19," So you're 51, and you do 16-hour days,",57.0,61.0,15,Elon_test
20," and you work seven hours a week, and you fly all over the place.",61.0,64.0,18,Elon_test
21," And you go to these meetings constantly,",64.0,67.0,10,Elon_test
22, and people constantly criticize you for everything.,67.0,70.0,10,Elon_test
23," It's amazing to me. I mean, you're changing the world,",70.0,72.0,17,Elon_test
24," and you're giving yourself, why do you do this?",72.0,74.0,14,Elon_test
25," So my wife says to me, why are you still working?",74.0,76.0,15,Elon_test
26, Why are you still working?,76.0,78.0,8,Elon_test
27, Why are you doing it here?,78.0,80.0,9,Elon_test
28," Well, I think what I'm working on has an important effect on the future.",80.0,89.0,19,Elon_test
29," In the case of Tesla, I think it's fair to say that Tesla has significantly accelerated",89.0,95.0,20,Elon_test
30, the advent of sustainable energy.,95.0,99.0,8,Elon_test
31," Before Tesla, no one was doing electric cars,",99.0,103.0,12,Elon_test
32," and now as a result of Tesla, I think almost every major car company in the world",103.0,108.0,20,Elon_test
33, is building electric cars.,108.0,112.0,7,Elon_test
34, And that's a pretty big deal.,112.0,116.0,10,Elon_test
35, But there's still a long way to go to transition the world,116.0,119.0,15,Elon_test
36, to a sustainable energy economy.,119.0,122.0,8,Elon_test
37," So we still have a lot of work ahead of us at Tesla,",122.0,125.0,16,Elon_test
38, but that's our goal there.,125.0,127.0,9,Elon_test
39," And then for SpaceX, I think it's important for the future to be exciting",127.0,133.0,18,Elon_test
40, and for humanity's existence to be insured over the long term.,133.0,139.0,16,Elon_test
41, I think we must become a multi-planet species and a space-bearing civilization.,139.0,144.0,21,Elon_test
42," You know, I think the...",144.0,148.0,9,Elon_test
43, We're here like 4.5 billion years after Earth got started.,148.0,157.0,16,Elon_test
44, 13.8 billion years into the age of the universe.,157.0,162.0,14,Elon_test
45," And it's only now recently in the last 5,000 years that we even...",162.0,167.0,19,Elon_test
46, we invented writing.,167.0,168.0,6,Elon_test
47, I would say date the first civilization by when we...,168.0,172.0,13,Elon_test
48," there was the first writing, which was in ancient Samaria around 5 or 6,000 years ago.",172.0,180.0,23,Elon_test
49, So we've basically just been here for a very brief instance.,180.0,185.0,15,Elon_test
50, A blink.,185.0,186.0,5,Elon_test
51," All of human civilization is a blink of an eye, if there wasn't eye,",186.0,192.0,19,Elon_test
52, in an evolutionary timescale.,192.0,195.0,8,Elon_test
53, So I think it's important we take the actions to ensure that the light of consciousness continues.,195.0,201.0,21,Elon_test
54," Because we should really view consciousness as a small candle,",201.0,207.0,13,Elon_test
55, an abast darkness.,207.0,209.0,7,Elon_test
56, It can easily go out.,209.0,211.0,8,Elon_test
57, So you have these missions.,211.0,214.0,8,Elon_test
58," And somehow, whenever you have a mission and you have this vision, and you are a visionary,",214.0,220.0,22,Elon_test
59," it's somehow, whatever you do, you develop other businesses.",220.0,225.0,15,Elon_test
60," So when you started SpaceX, you didn't think about satellites.",225.0,229.0,15,Elon_test
61," When you started Tesla, you didn't think about robots.",229.0,232.0,14,Elon_test
62," When you don't have enough people, you didn't think about robots.",232.0,235.0,17,Elon_test
63, And so you didn't think about autonomous driving.,235.0,238.0,12,Elon_test
64," And without Elon, there would not be electric cars.",238.0,242.0,13,Elon_test
65, Nobody who makes cars wants to make electric cars.,242.0,245.0,12,Elon_test
66, They're being forced to make them.,245.0,247.0,10,Elon_test
67," In fact, every time they sell electric cars, they sell one fewer car that they make money on.",247.0,253.0,23,Elon_test
68, And they have all that money invested in plants that make those other cars.,253.0,256.0,17,Elon_test
69, So nobody wants to have these cars except for him.,256.0,259.0,13,Elon_test
70, And everybody thought it was going to fail.,259.0,262.0,11,Elon_test
71, And one of the things you said is that patents are for the week.,263.0,268.0,17,Elon_test
72, And you share your patents.,268.0,271.0,8,Elon_test
73," And with other companies, of course, on the other hand, when they get your patents,",271.0,275.0,21,Elon_test
74, you're two or three years ahead of them.,275.0,279.0,12,Elon_test
75," Well, I mean, I started joking about patents for the week.",279.0,282.0,16,Elon_test
76, I think there is a role for patents.,282.0,284.0,11,Elon_test
77," You know, let's say if somebody has spent, if someone company has spent a lot of money developing,",284.0,288.0,24,Elon_test
78, they're particularly medicine and had to go through the expense of stage three medical trials.,288.0,293.0,19,Elon_test
79, And then they finally get something that is approved.,293.0,296.0,12,Elon_test
80," But where the drug itself is cheap to manufacture, then I think a patent in that case makes sense.",296.0,302.0,23,Elon_test
81," Otherwise, no one would go to the trouble of doing stage three medical trials.",302.0,306.0,18,Elon_test
82, So there are definitely roles for patents.,306.0,308.0,10,Elon_test
83," In the case of Tesla, our goal is to advance sustainable energy.",308.0,314.0,16,Elon_test
84, And we can't just do it by ourselves when we need the whole industry to go that way.,315.0,321.0,22,Elon_test
85, So we gave them our patents for free in order to help them accelerate electric vehicles.,321.0,328.0,19,Elon_test
86, So must be terrifying to other companies to realize that we make cars.,328.0,333.0,16,Elon_test
87," It's $39,000 and costs the car.",333.0,336.0,13,Elon_test
88," And we're making $15,000, $16,000 and profit a car.",336.0,340.0,20,Elon_test
89, And so we invest $7 billion and we make $15 billion a year.,340.0,346.0,18,Elon_test
90," I'm sorry, yeah.",346.0,349.0,8,Elon_test
91," 15, right.",349.0,351.0,6,Elon_test
92," A million cars, 15,000, 15,000 a million a year on a $7 million investment.",351.0,357.0,24,Elon_test
93, Shocking.,357.0,358.0,5,Elon_test
94, So no one else does that.,358.0,360.0,9,Elon_test
95," And when we're, and here you're telling us how you want to make cars for $20,000 a piece.",360.0,366.0,27,Elon_test
96, How do you do that?,366.0,369.0,8,Elon_test
97, We've not formally announced an X-Car program.,370.0,374.0,13,Elon_test
98, So I can't talk too much about our upcoming vehicle program or programs that have not been announced.,374.0,382.0,22,Elon_test
99, But we do expect to make cars that are more affordable than the current Model 3 Model Y.,382.0,392.0,21,Elon_test
100," And a big factor in this is, yeah.",392.0,396.0,12,Elon_test
101, I think by far the biggest factor is autonomy.,396.0,405.0,12,Elon_test
102," And the, in terms of value of a car, because right now cars get driven for about 10 or 12 hours a week,",405.0,415.0,28,Elon_test
103, like maybe one and a half hours a day.,415.0,419.0,12,Elon_test
104," So, but there's 168 hours a week.",420.0,424.0,13,Elon_test
105," And so if there were autonomous, you could probably drive, the cars could drive for 50 or 60 hours.",424.0,429.0,24,Elon_test
106, So you would see a five-fold increase in the utility of the car that could be autonomy.,429.0,437.0,22,Elon_test
107," This is a really, really gigantic thing.",437.0,440.0,11,Elon_test
108," It also means that there was, we wouldn't need anywhere near as many parking lots.",440.0,445.0,20,Elon_test
109, And the should also be helpful for the environment because you would need far fewer cars.,446.0,451.0,19,Elon_test
110, So I'm a spoke.,451.0,453.0,8,Elon_test
111, It was a $7 billion investment for a plant that makes a million cars a year that makes $15 billion in your own profits.,453.0,459.0,29,Elon_test
112, So you invest $7 billion and you make $15 billion a year.,459.0,463.0,17,Elon_test
113, Who does that?,463.0,464.0,6,Elon_test
114," And for a plant that makes, you know, things, manufacturing.",464.0,470.0,16,Elon_test
115, And so the way this is accomplished is that so you're doing it with casting right now.,471.0,476.0,21,Elon_test
116, And casting half of the car and you can soon cast the other half of the car.,476.0,480.0,20,Elon_test
117," And other companies, why don't they try?",480.0,483.0,12,Elon_test
118," Why don't they try to do the, do what we're doing?",483.0,486.0,17,Elon_test
119," In fact, one of the executives of another one of a vehicle company wanted me to introduce her to you.",486.0,493.0,24,Elon_test
120," And you did that once in a meeting and now she wants to come visit with her director of engineering,",493.0,498.0,23,Elon_test
121, and she wants to go to the plant in Austin.,498.0,501.0,13,Elon_test
122," And I presume when I ask you, you're going to say, yeah, bring her on because you innovate so fast by the time anyone copies what we're doing,",501.0,508.0,36,Elon_test
123, it's around to something else.,508.0,510.0,9,Elon_test
124, What else is there?,510.0,511.0,7,Elon_test
125," When you're casting, what else is there that enables us to make a cheaper,",511.0,516.0,19,Elon_test
126, to eliminate a lot of other parts or eliminate functions?,516.0,519.0,13,Elon_test
127, What are we doing to do that?,519.0,522.0,10,Elon_test
128, How would we sell a car that's so cheap?,522.0,525.0,13,Elon_test
129," I mean, I think the full explanation or at least an accurate explanation would take a long time,",526.0,532.0,22,Elon_test
130," because first approximation of cars made of 10,000 unique parts and process steps.",532.0,539.0,18,Elon_test
131," And I mean, Tesla is really, I think at this point, probably the best at manufacturing in the auto industry,",539.0,548.0,26,Elon_test
132, which I think nobody was expecting.,548.0,551.0,9,Elon_test
133, Probably in history of the world.,551.0,553.0,9,Elon_test
134, Probably.,553.0,555.0,4,Elon_test
135," Yeah, so, well, I've got this like first principles algorithm that are fine to be very helpful in the design and manufacturing of anything.",555.0,574.0,31,Elon_test
136, And people here may find it helpful.,574.0,579.0,10,Elon_test
137, The first thing you should do is make the requirements that you've been given a less dumb.,580.0,589.0,21,Elon_test
138," Whatever constraints and requirements were given, there were some degree dumb and you want to make them less dumb.",589.0,595.0,23,Elon_test
139," If you don't do the start with this, then you can answer the right answers to the wrong question.",595.0,603.0,24,Elon_test
140," And the requirements must be given from a person who can explain the requirement, not from a department,",603.0,611.0,22,Elon_test
141, because then you don't know who to talk to.,611.0,614.0,13,Elon_test
142, Then step two is delete the part or delete the process step.,614.0,620.0,15,Elon_test
143, This sounds extremely obvious.,620.0,623.0,7,Elon_test
144," And yet over and over again, we have found that parts were not needed.",623.0,629.0,18,Elon_test
145, They were just put in there just in case or by mistake.,629.0,634.0,15,Elon_test
146," Or there was a step that people someone thought was needed, but was not actually needed.",634.0,639.0,20,Elon_test
147," The sounds saying the obvious, but we've deleted so many parts from the car that were did nothing.",639.0,647.0,23,Elon_test
148, They were just there?,647.0,648.0,7,Elon_test
149," Well, yeah, I mean, I have so many examples.",648.0,654.0,15,Elon_test
150, One example was there were three fiberglass mats on top of the battery pack.,654.0,661.0,18,Elon_test
151, They partially covered the battery pack.,661.0,664.0,9,Elon_test
152, And it was on the battery pack production line.,664.0,667.0,12,Elon_test
153, And it was the number one thing choking battery pack production.,667.0,671.0,14,Elon_test
154, These were gluing on these three fiberglass mats at the top of the battery pack.,671.0,676.0,20,Elon_test
155, And so the reason I repeat the cell phone myself is that I first did things backwards.,676.0,682.0,20,Elon_test
156, First I tried to automate it.,682.0,685.0,9,Elon_test
157," Then I tried to accelerate it, just have the scope faster.",685.0,690.0,15,Elon_test
158, Then I tried to simplify it.,690.0,693.0,9,Elon_test
159, And only then did I delete it.,693.0,697.0,10,Elon_test
160, Because it turned out that the the the team that tells us that there's noise and vibration minimization.,697.0,709.0,23,Elon_test
161, So making making the car quiet.,709.0,712.0,9,Elon_test
162, Thought that the fiberglass mats were there because of the battery safety team for to battery fire production.,712.0,719.0,22,Elon_test
163," And then I asked the battery fire prevention team what were they needed for and they said, oh, noise and vibration.",719.0,726.0,26,Elon_test
164," And I'm like, okay.",726.0,729.0,9,Elon_test
165, So then we had two cars drive one with a microphone in the car in each car.,729.0,735.0,20,Elon_test
166, And you could not tell the difference.,735.0,738.0,10,Elon_test
167, So we went to all that trouble for a part that should not exist.,738.0,742.0,17,Elon_test
168, And then another another example was there was a.,742.0,747.0,12,Elon_test
169," Again, this was like these were choke points in the entire production system.",747.0,750.0,17,Elon_test
170, That's why they you know I'm running around the production line trying to fix the production line.,750.0,754.0,22,Elon_test
171, Just like a maniac.,754.0,756.0,7,Elon_test
172, It was a Tasmanian devil just running around the factory like a lunatic.,756.0,761.0,19,Elon_test
173, And let's see we had the body production line a model through with one point stuck because we had a laser welding cell to weld a small cross car beam in the passenger footwell of the front seats.,761.0,778.0,43,Elon_test
174," And I'm like at this sort of this beam and I'm like, what the heck does that do?",778.0,783.0,24,Elon_test
175, Because the entire factory stopped trying to try to get the laser weld cell to work.,783.0,791.0,19,Elon_test
176," And I'm like, I can't imagine what a useful thing it could do.",791.0,795.0,19,Elon_test
177," And the team said the production team said, oh, that's for crash safety.",795.0,799.0,19,Elon_test
178," So then I called the crash safety team and said, is this for crash safety?",799.0,803.0,19,Elon_test
179," And I said, oh no, that didn't do anything. We should delete it.",803.0,808.0,20,Elon_test
180, I turned out to be totally useless.,808.0,810.0,10,Elon_test
181, But they forgot to tell the production team.,810.0,813.0,11,Elon_test
182," So, so I see a bunch of these things just feel like you're living in a Dilbert cartoon.",813.0,820.0,24,Elon_test
183," Oh no, what's our what?",820.0,822.0,10,Elon_test
184, Any given company?,822.0,824.0,6,Elon_test
185, What's your Dilbert ratio?,824.0,826.0,9,Elon_test
186, Okay.,826.0,827.0,4,Elon_test
187, It's not zero.,827.0,829.0,7,Elon_test
188, So is this you or is this your goal?,829.0,832.0,12,Elon_test
189, Dilbert question. Try to keep it low.,832.0,834.0,12,Elon_test
190, So is this you or is this you?,834.0,837.0,11,Elon_test
191, So you do all these different things.,837.0,839.0,10,Elon_test
192, That's literally me.,839.0,841.0,7,Elon_test
193, So do you have someone else who did this?,841.0,843.0,12,Elon_test
194, I was living in the factory in Fremont and the one in Nevada for three years straight.,843.0,851.0,22,Elon_test
195, It was my primary residence.,851.0,853.0,8,Elon_test
196," Not kidding, literally.",853.0,854.0,7,Elon_test
197, Did you keep the couch?,854.0,856.0,8,Elon_test
198, I actually stepped a reception account at one point on a tent on the roof.,856.0,862.0,18,Elon_test
199," And then for a while there I was just sleeping under my desk, which is out in the open in the factory.",862.0,870.0,26,Elon_test
200, And for an important reason.,870.0,872.0,8,Elon_test
201, And it was damn uncomfortable sleeping on that floor.,872.0,874.0,12,Elon_test
202, And always when I woke up I'd smell like metal dust.,874.0,877.0,15,Elon_test
203, We went to visit and they bought him a new couch.,877.0,880.0,14,Elon_test
204, Yeah.,880.0,881.0,4,Elon_test
205," But actually I stopped using the couch in the, in the, in the, because there's a little conference room in a couch there.",881.0,886.0,30,Elon_test
206, I stopped using the couch.,886.0,887.0,8,Elon_test
207," I just stepped on the floor under my desk so that the, so during shift change the entire team could see me.",887.0,894.0,26,Elon_test
208," And this is important because like, you know, the, the team, like, if, if, if they think that the, the sort of, the leader is, is off somewhere having a good time, you know, drinking my ties on a tropical island, which I could definitely have to do.",894.0,910.0,64,Elon_test
209," And, and would much have preferred to do.",910.0,913.0,12,Elon_test
210," I'm not, I'm not actually a masochist, I think.",913.0,918.0,18,Elon_test
211," But, but the thing is that since the team could see me sleeping on the floor.",918.0,923.0,20,Elon_test
212, During shift change.,923.0,926.0,6,Elon_test
213, It was just not with nothing.,926.0,930.0,9,Elon_test
214," The, the new I was there.",930.0,932.0,10,Elon_test
215, And that made a huge difference.,932.0,934.0,9,Elon_test

217," So, so the focus is on always lowering costs and providing leadership.",936.0,945.0,16,Elon_test
218," And, and this company we're doing a million and a half cars a year, but expected to 20.",945.0,951.0,24,Elon_test
219," And, and so what happens in 10 years if you're not there?",951.0,955.0,17,Elon_test
220, What happens in five years if you're not there?,955.0,957.0,13,Elon_test
221, How does that work?,957.0,958.0,7,Elon_test
222," I mean, all these people, so it all the engineering schools, the top engineering schools, the top choice of where everybody wants to work.",958.0,965.0,31,Elon_test
223, It's test their space X.,965.0,968.0,9,Elon_test
224, Those two places.,968.0,969.0,6,Elon_test
225," So, do we have all these people coming up and finding each other for the job or the working together?",969.0,975.0,24,Elon_test

229, But we do have that problem a little bit.,986.0,989.0,12,Elon_test
230," So, you know, as a company has prosperity.",989.0,992.0,13,Elon_test

242," And so we have, no, competitors sort of, yes.",1060.0,1065.0,15,Elon_test

244," It's just, it's just Boeing North have been lucky.",1071.0,1075.0,15,Elon_test

246, And we had a build with launching pad.,1083.0,1086.0,11,Elon_test
247," And of course, a few hundred million dollars and did it in six months.",1086.0,1089.0,18,Elon_test
248," And, and then I was interested in how that was done.",1089.0,1094.0,15,Elon_test
249," And a woman I'm talking to says that, Ron, did you see the plumbing when you went there?",1094.0,1100.0,24,Elon_test

252," And she said, well, you should be aware that there's all these pipes that take away the heat.",1109.0,1114.0,24,Elon_test
253," And then they all deliver fuel to the rocket and it has to be there in exact, right amount at the exact right time.",1114.0,1121.0,28,Elon_test
254," And if it's not, that doesn't happen, it blows up.",1121.0,1123.0,17,Elon_test
255," And I said, well, how does Elon know this?",1123.0,1126.0,14,Elon_test
256," And because you hire these great people and then you ask them all these questions,",1126.0,1131.0,18,Elon_test
257, then somehow you remember everything I tell you. Is that true?,1131.0,1135.0,15,Elon_test
258," Well, my memory for technical matters is very good.",1135.0,1140.0,13,Elon_test
259," But I think probably a lot of people don't realize, like what I do, apes in the time is engineering.",1140.0,1149.0,27,Elon_test
260," So, you know, it's quite actually quite rare for me to give a talk.",1149.0,1154.0,20,Elon_test
261, And my day to day work at SpaceX and Tesla is almost entirely engineering and design.,1154.0,1163.0,19,Elon_test
262," So, and also production, production is key, but although I consider that to be part of engineering.",1163.0,1172.0,23,Elon_test
263," Yeah, so, but Starship is something special.",1172.0,1181.0,13,Elon_test
264," The thing that is, like the holy grail, like the critical breakthrough needed to make life multiplanetary and for humanity to be a space-bearing civilization is a fully and rapidly reusable rocket, open rocket.",1181.0,1199.0,47,Elon_test
265, And so we've gone most of the way there with Falcon 9.,1199.0,1203.0,16,Elon_test
266, You may have seen the rocket boost to come back and land.,1203.0,1206.0,15,Elon_test
267, And we also recover the nose cone or faring.,1206.0,1210.0,13,Elon_test
268, But we do not recover the upper stage.,1210.0,1213.0,11,Elon_test
269," So, we've gone to the point where we're about, you know, 70 to 80% reusable with Falcon 9.",1213.0,1222.0,27,Elon_test

271," I cannot, it's able to say how profound a change this will be.",1227.0,1231.0,18,Elon_test
272," But a fully and rapidly reusable, open rocket has the potential to drop the cost of access to the rocket.",1231.0,1239.0,24,Elon_test
273," So, it's a very, very big rocket.",1239.0,1242.0,13,Elon_test
274, It's more than twice the thrust of a Saturn V and about twice the mass.,1242.0,1263.0,19,Elon_test
275," And it's also, the entire ship is designed to land propulsively.",1263.0,1269.0,18,Elon_test

277," To land on its engines, land propulsively.",1272.0,1274.0,13,Elon_test
278," So, it can land on any solid surface in the solar system.",1274.0,1278.0,16,Elon_test
279," So, if we can make Starship work, then it enables us to, over time, get anywhere in the solar system.",1278.0,1286.0,28,Elon_test
280," So, why is it so hard?",1286.0,1288.0,10,Elon_test
281, Why don't other people do the same thing?,1288.0,1290.0,12,Elon_test
282, Everyone says it's impossible.,1290.0,1292.0,8,Elon_test
283, And how much harder is it to do what we're trying to do than we're doing with Falcon?,1292.0,1298.0,23,Elon_test
284," Well, so, it's a...",1298.0,1302.0,10,Elon_test
285, Both gravity is actually quite strong and we have a thick atmosphere.,1302.0,1307.0,15,Elon_test
286," So, with known physics, it is only barely possible to make a fully reusable orbital rocket.",1307.0,1314.0,21,Elon_test
287, Only barely possible.,1314.0,1317.0,6,Elon_test
288, This was a video game that the setting is to extreme difficulty.,1317.0,1321.0,15,Elon_test
289," Not impossible, but extreme difficulty.",1321.0,1325.0,9,Elon_test
290, Because it's not like those who have developed rockets before weren't aware of reusability.,1325.0,1331.0,20,Elon_test
291, They were fully aware of the rockets.,1331.0,1334.0,10,Elon_test
292, They're fully aware of reusability.,1334.0,1336.0,10,Elon_test
293, They'll aircraft and cars are reusable.,1336.0,1339.0,10,Elon_test
294," It's just that in order for a rocket to be reusable, everything has to be perfect.",1339.0,1345.0,21,Elon_test
295," So, you have to have exceptionally efficient engines.",1345.0,1350.0,12,Elon_test
296, You have to have an exceptionally efficient structure.,1350.0,1354.0,11,Elon_test
297, You need advanced avionics and software.,1354.0,1358.0,11,Elon_test
298, You need a very lightweight heat shield for orbital reentry.,1358.0,1365.0,14,Elon_test
299, And then another key factor for traveling to Mars is you need orbital refilling.,1365.0,1371.0,18,Elon_test
300," So, that you get the ship to orbit and then you send up tankers to refill the ship in orbit.",1371.0,1378.0,25,Elon_test
301, That is done by the Air Force with aerial refueling.,1378.0,1384.0,15,Elon_test
302, Those are the things that are necessary.,1384.0,1388.0,10,Elon_test
303, It's never been achieved before.,1388.0,1392.0,9,Elon_test
304, There have been many attempts to achieve it.,1392.0,1396.0,11,Elon_test
305, And they've all failed.,1396.0,1399.0,8,Elon_test
306, And usually they had counseled the program partway through once they thought it was no longer possible.,1399.0,1406.0,22,Elon_test
307," So, it's a very difficult engineering challenge.",1406.0,1409.0,12,Elon_test
308," So, SLS is supposed to get to the moon.",1409.0,1412.0,14,Elon_test
309, They got a contract in 2010.,1412.0,1415.0,9,Elon_test
310," It was supposed to be for $10 billion, but it was cost plus.",1415.0,1419.0,18,Elon_test
311, It's now up to $40 billion and they say it's going to be $100 billion and $90 billion.,1419.0,1424.0,26,Elon_test
312, And we haven't gotten anything.,1424.0,1427.0,9,Elon_test
313, And we have our rocket is 10 meters taller than theirs.,1427.0,1433.0,14,Elon_test
314, And we can reuse ours.,1433.0,1436.0,8,Elon_test
315, How can anyone possibly compete if they're not doing what we're doing?,1436.0,1440.0,17,Elon_test
316, How can they compete?,1440.0,1442.0,7,Elon_test
317, I don't understand.,1442.0,1444.0,7,Elon_test
318, And how can they get contracts?,1444.0,1446.0,9,Elon_test
319, And then I just saw something from NASA.,1446.0,1448.0,11,Elon_test
320," And they said that we're spending $20 billion a year and by the way that's the $360,000 jobs in all of these congressional districts.",1448.0,1458.0,33,Elon_test
321," Well, I think this, I'm be careful of what I say here.",1458.0,1465.0,18,Elon_test
322, I have enough enemies.,1465.0,1470.0,7,Elon_test
323," I would like to have, you know, I think, I think, yes, I would like to have smaller, smaller number of companies that want me to die.",1470.0,1486.0,36,Elon_test
324, That would be great.,1486.0,1493.0,7,Elon_test
325," So, I think part of this is like, what's the goal?",1493.0,1503.0,17,Elon_test
326," In the case of Starship, the goal is to lower the cost of access to orbit and ultimately to Mars and the moon and elsewhere,",1503.0,1514.0,30,Elon_test
327," to the point where humanity can actually afford to become a multi-planet species, to the point where we can afford to have a permanent base on the moon,",1514.0,1523.0,35,Elon_test
328," and ultimately far exceed the high watermark of Apollo, which was incredible.",1523.0,1528.0,17,Elon_test

330," If you would ask people, I think, what was in any country, not Americans, anyone?",1532.0,1540.0,22,Elon_test
331," What was the greatest, what was humanity's greatest achievement in the 20th century?",1540.0,1545.0,19,Elon_test
332, Maybe everyone.,1545.0,1547.0,5,Elon_test
333, Let's go to the moon.,1547.0,1549.0,9,Elon_test
334," And that's why they say, Ruchot as a metaphor, because that was incredible.",1549.0,1557.0,21,Elon_test
335," You know, it's still amazing that there was achieved.",1557.0,1561.0,14,Elon_test
336," In fact, a lot of people asked me, was it real?",1561.0,1564.0,16,Elon_test
337," I'm like, yeah, it was real.",1564.0,1567.0,12,Elon_test
338," Well, it was probably on Twitter, that's where they asked that.",1567.0,1570.0,17,Elon_test
339, Yeah.,1570.0,1576.0,4,Elon_test
340," I mean, that was just an incredible achievement.",1576.0,1579.0,12,Elon_test
341," And I think it's just one of those things that, you know, going to the moon makes Ruchot be a member of humanity.",1579.0,1587.0,31,Elon_test

343," That's, it was for all mankind.",1591.0,1594.0,11,Elon_test
344, So it's amazing achievements.,1594.0,1598.0,8,Elon_test
345, And now we have this web telescope.,1598.0,1601.0,10,Elon_test
346, I guess the big bang was 14 billion years ago.,1601.0,1604.0,13,Elon_test
347, And first light is 13 and a half billion years ago.,1604.0,1607.0,14,Elon_test
348, And our planet's 4 and a half billion.,1607.0,1609.0,12,Elon_test
349, So what did we get out of this?,1609.0,1611.0,11,Elon_test
350," What is the, you know, so I, so obviously Starling, a really big deal.",1611.0,1616.0,22,Elon_test
351," The trained dollar opportunity, maybe, maybe more.",1616.0,1620.0,12,Elon_test
352," And, so what do we get out of seeing back 13 and a half billion years?",1620.0,1629.0,20,Elon_test
353, What does that do for us?,1629.0,1631.0,9,Elon_test
354, What technology do we develop?,1631.0,1632.0,8,Elon_test
355, Or do we know?,1632.0,1633.0,7,Elon_test
356, We don't know until we do it.,1633.0,1635.0,11,Elon_test
357," Yeah, I think.",1635.0,1638.0,7,Elon_test
358, Yeah.,1638.0,1645.0,4,Elon_test
359," I think like this, too, there's two main motivations, I think, for becoming a multi-planet species",1646.0,1652.0,26,Elon_test
360, and a space-breaking civilization and ultimately going beyond that to go to other star systems and explore the galaxy.,1652.0,1662.0,24,Elon_test
361, And I think we may find that there's many one planet civilizations that died out millions of years ago and never made it to the second planet.,1662.0,1670.0,31,Elon_test
362, Do you think in your lifetime that's happens?,1670.0,1673.0,12,Elon_test
363," Well, it turns out how long I live.",1673.0,1676.0,12,Elon_test
364, Maybe forever.,1676.0,1678.0,5,Elon_test
365, I keep increasing that enemy's lives listed might not be much longer.,1678.0,1685.0,16,Elon_test
366, We deeply ironic if someone angry on Twitter that takes me out.,1685.0,1693.0,15,Elon_test
367," Well, that's, he's a wolf Twitter.",1693.0,1695.0,13,Elon_test
368," Yeah, exactly.",1695.0,1697.0,6,Elon_test
369," Anyway, I think there's two reasons for life to become multi-planetary.",1697.0,1705.0,20,Elon_test
370, Life as we know it to become multi-planetary.,1705.0,1707.0,15,Elon_test
371," I think one is the defensive reason where we just, I think, we want the light of consciousness to not be extinguished if something would happen to Earth.",1707.0,1716.0,35,Elon_test
372," And in the case of the dinosaurs, they only have to worry about meteors and two volcanoes and other things.",1716.0,1724.0,25,Elon_test
373," But for us humans, we actually have the power to destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons or some sort of, you know, crazy bio terrorism thing.",1724.0,1736.0,31,Elon_test
374," So, you know, so the some danger that is not zero that could cause the end of life on Earth as we know it.",1736.0,1747.0,29,Elon_test
375, So that's kind of the defensive reason to ensure that life is not just an end consciousness.,1747.0,1752.0,21,Elon_test
376, It's just it's not only on Earth that that's the defensive reason to protect the future of consciousness.,1752.0,1760.0,24,Elon_test
377," Then the other big reason, I think, is that it's exciting and it's it's adventurous and it's it's it's inspiring.",1760.0,1771.0,31,Elon_test
378," It makes it like it makes you think positively about the future, you know, and life can't just be about solving one problem or another.",1771.0,1783.0,31,Elon_test
379, There needs to be reasons to be inspired.,1783.0,1786.0,11,Elon_test
380," You know, reasons that move your heart and say yes, the future is going to be great.",1786.0,1791.0,22,Elon_test
381," And when you get out, you know, when you wake up in the morning, I can't wait to see what happens next.",1791.0,1796.0,29,Elon_test
382," And I think that's, you know, humanity, go to Mars, even if you don't yourself want to go to Mars and most people don't just just watch it.",1796.0,1807.0,38,Elon_test
383," It's a tough gig, frankly.",1807.0,1810.0,10,Elon_test
384, This would this would not be a luxury expedition.,1810.0,1814.0,12,Elon_test
385, And but but but you'd be able to watch it happen.,1814.0,1817.0,15,Elon_test
386, And I think it would just be incredibly inspiring to the world in the same way that the Apollo program was inspiring to the world.,1817.0,1823.0,28,Elon_test
387," And like I said, there's got to be life can't just be about solving one problem or another.",1823.0,1828.0,24,Elon_test
388, We need things that are that make us excited and inspired about the future and that would be one of them.,1828.0,1835.0,24,Elon_test
389, So let's go to Twitter just for a minute and we'll go back to this stuff which is more interesting to me.,1835.0,1847.0,27,Elon_test
390, I try to get out of the deal.,1847.0,1852.0,11,Elon_test
391, I told me you wanted to ask you get out.,1852.0,1857.0,13,Elon_test
392, I'm not that seen from the Godfather basically.,1857.0,1860.0,13,Elon_test
393, But you told me you wanted to ask tough questions.,1860.0,1864.0,13,Elon_test
394, I try to get.,1864.0,1869.0,7,Elon_test
395, So so in Twitter.,1869.0,1872.0,7,Elon_test
396, What could possibly go wrong?,1872.0,1877.0,8,Elon_test
397, So I saw this article.,1877.0,1880.0,8,Elon_test
398, Says you what something called Twitter.,1880.0,1884.0,9,Elon_test
399, And it says must put so off lifting Twitter bands.,1884.0,1888.0,13,Elon_test
400, And so obviously the big deal in to me anyway in in Twitter is that so we have this incredible.,1888.0,1896.0,23,Elon_test
401, So it's incredibly poorly managed this business.,1896.0,1900.0,11,Elon_test
402, But those guys somehow did great for their shareholders by selling it to us.,1900.0,1907.0,17,Elon_test
403, But we didn't buy what they're selling.,1907.0,1909.0,12,Elon_test
404, We bought something of what is going to become.,1909.0,1912.0,12,Elon_test
405, Yes.,1912.0,1913.0,4,Elon_test
406, I mean I think it's a most people would say like given where how the market has evolved this year the price is on the high side.,1913.0,1923.0,31,Elon_test
407, Right.,1923.0,1924.0,4,Elon_test
408, But that's on the base of what it is.,1924.0,1926.0,13,Elon_test
409, But in terms of what what I think there is a tremendous amount of potential.,1926.0,1931.0,18,Elon_test
410, That it will be very difficult to achieve but I think possible.,1931.0,1935.0,15,Elon_test
411, And I think ultimately it could be one of the most valuable companies in the world.,1935.0,1940.0,19,Elon_test
412, So so when we think about this in order for that to happen.,1940.0,1945.0,16,Elon_test
413, In order for that so I met you and took me a few years and then I believe in you and your heart.,1945.0,1953.0,26,Elon_test
414, Right.,1953.0,1954.0,4,Elon_test
415, And I think you're a skeptical at our first meeting you were a bit skeptical.,1954.0,1960.0,19,Elon_test
416, And so so the way I think about it is that so I'm trusting you with the future of our country or the world actually when you're in charge of a media like that.,1960.0,1970.0,39,Elon_test
417, And so what I think about is so how do you prevent to be in Jewish.,1970.0,1975.0,19,Elon_test
418, How do you prevent this anti-Semitism or if I were black how do you prevent all of the.,1975.0,1982.0,24,Elon_test
419, So to how do you prevent the use of the N word and when I think about tiktok and they're able.,1982.0,1992.0,27,Elon_test
420, We're just looking at pictures to tell what you're going to do you know you move your left arm you move your right arm what you other pictures you like.,1992.0,2000.0,35,Elon_test
421, That's what they do with their software and they great their algorithm.,2000.0,2003.0,16,Elon_test
422, How can we not have an amazing algorithm because we know more about them do with tiktok.,2003.0,2009.0,22,Elon_test
423, And we ought to know what interests people have and and because of that in words we should be able to figure out words that people are using what that means and considering what they.,2009.0,2021.0,38,Elon_test
424, Content they're interested in we should be able to figure out the software how to moderate this and prevent that from happening is that true or not.,2021.0,2028.0,31,Elon_test
425," Yes, yes absolutely.",2028.0,2030.0,7,Elon_test
426, It's only agreed.,2030.0,2033.0,7,Elon_test
427, I want to be clear the.,2033.0,2036.0,9,Elon_test
428, You know content moderation policies have not changed at Twitter and it is not not OK to engage in hateful conduct on Twitter.,2036.0,2047.0,27,Elon_test
429, So we have had like actually oddly like targeted attacks where temporarily people have been able to put some hate speech on Twitter but.,2047.0,2064.0,27,Elon_test
430, And then it's been taken down immediately so now.,2064.0,2070.0,13,Elon_test
431, I don't want to try to achieve with the sort of enabling everyone to be payment verified with with Twitter blue is to try to get as many people.,2070.0,2080.0,33,Elon_test
432, Payment verified as possible it's only eight bucks a month.,2080.0,2085.0,15,Elon_test
433, Although for some people that we're complaining about that and these are people who pay more with the net for their lots of.,2085.0,2091.0,27,Elon_test
434, How many of you want your.,2091.0,2094.0,9,Elon_test
435, But it's like a part of its revenue part of it is payment authentication and so if somebody because there is a huge problem with spam and and bots and trolls on Twitter and organizations trying to manipulate public opinion and just just generally making the system worse.,2094.0,2117.0,52,Elon_test
436, I think but I think that there is an answer to that which is to get as many regularly uses of Twitter to be a subscriber for eight dollars a month and you'll get a lot more than just the blue checkmark for eight dollars a month because now we can afford long form video long long audio podcasts.,2117.0,2137.0,64,Elon_test
437, And we can also start sharing revenue with content creators which is essential.,2137.0,2142.0,16,Elon_test
438, So I think that's the right way to make them a chance to make money.,2142.0,2145.0,19,Elon_test
439, Yeah absolutely just so I mean right now if you're on Twitter you'll see a lot of links posted to YouTube and and TikTok and that's because at least until now Twitter is not allowed even given them enough video length to post their video.,2145.0,2160.0,51,Elon_test
440, And then they give the content creators no means monetizing the video so we're going to change that rapidly at Twitter that's going to be transformative.,2160.0,2169.0,32,Elon_test
441, So we're going to do that with the users and we're going to prioritize Twitter search replies mentions by verified users first.,2169.0,2181.0,27,Elon_test
442, And yeah that's what get him that's what calls amplified.,2181.0,2185.0,15,Elon_test
443, So the so if you payment verified with blue checkmark then you'll be prioritized.,2185.0,2192.0,20,Elon_test
444, And so this the point of this is to make crime not pay because right now to create a bot on Twitter class less than a penny.,2192.0,2204.0,30,Elon_test
445, So the cost of crime is so cheap and that's part of why crime and hate for conduct pays but if somebody risks losing even eight bucks that they or it's too expensive to now have a hundred thousand fake accounts.,2204.0,2219.0,46,Elon_test
446, Is that just been eight hundred thousand dollars a month as opposed to you know eight hundred dollars a month.,2219.0,2228.0,23,Elon_test
447, So and then we also since we're using payment authentication we're picking on the authentication system of the payment system and we're also picking off of apples authentication system which is another layer of security.,2228.0,2243.0,41,Elon_test
448, So the net effect will be over time that the verified users will be will pretty much always be at the top of comments and search and you won't really see you'll have to scroll far to see the un verified users which will be the bots and trolls and whatnot.,2243.0,2262.0,56,Elon_test
449, So this is sort of analogous to Google search like if you go to page eight of Google search there will be a ton of scams and and stuff you know call it page eight page nine something like that.,2262.0,2279.0,45,Elon_test
450, And the thing is that Google search results are so good for page one that you never go to page eight.,2279.0,2286.0,24,Elon_test
451, So it's rare and like the old joke is like something we don't want to see it gets pushed way down.,2286.0,2292.0,26,Elon_test
452, Yeah just put basically the bad stuff gets pushed way down and and and then crime self paying and then they stop trying to do all these things.,2292.0,2301.0,31,Elon_test
453, And we can recruit them as engineers to program for us crime guys.,2301.0,2305.0,16,Elon_test
454, So I mean the joke is like what's the best place to hide a dead body would be the second page of Google search results.,2305.0,2314.0,29,Elon_test
455, Nobody ever goes there.,2314.0,2318.0,7,Elon_test
456, So today we fired half of Twitter and that should save us what for Bay in a year.,2318.0,2328.0,21,Elon_test
457, No it's not going to save 4 billion a year I wish but so to be frank Twitter was having pretty serious revenue challenges and cost challenges before the acquisition talks started and any company that is dependent on advertising has had a hard time.,2328.0,2350.0,49,Elon_test
458, So if you look at say snap or you know Google Facebook why not they will had a difficult time with advertising revenue dropping and Twitter is more currently more vulnerable than they are to advertising because most of Twitter's advertising is large brand advertising as opposed to direct response.,2350.0,2374.0,54,Elon_test
459, So it's kind of like a much more discretionary ad spend than it is for like if you if you if you can do direct response for a specific product.,2374.0,2388.0,35,Elon_test
460, So and then we also recently had a lot of difficulty with activist groups pressuring major advertisers to stop spending money on Twitter.,2388.0,2401.0,27,Elon_test
461, This is despite us doing everything possible to appease them and to make it clear that moderation rules and hateful content rules have not changed and we're continuing to enforce them.,2401.0,2412.0,37,Elon_test
462, So the number of major advertisers have stopped spending on Twitter.,2412.0,2418.0,14,Elon_test
463, But this is this doesn't seem right because we've made no change in our operations at all and but nonetheless the activist groups have been successful in causing a massive drop in Twitter advertising revenue and we've done our absolute best to appease them and nothing is working.,2418.0,2440.0,55,Elon_test
464, So this is a major concern and I think this is frankly an attack on the first amendment.,2440.0,2447.0,21,Elon_test
465, Like if activist groups can pressure advertisers upon which Twitter is fundamentally dependent to you know suppress free speech then that doesn't seem right.,2447.0,2468.0,28,Elon_test
466, So I went by the way 400 million instead of 4 billion. I meant actually 400 million instead of 4 billion.,2468.0,2477.0,25,Elon_test
467, Okay so so we're now there living at this place you go there for next couple three weeks you can devote and then we have a team lined up you think you have a team lined up to manage it and then you would just do it the same way we do with space action test though where you just attend the meetings regularly say this is what we need to do.,2477.0,2497.0,76,Elon_test
468, Do it.,2497.0,2502.0,5,Elon_test
469, Well this is what we need.,2502.0,2505.0,9,Elon_test
470, Yeah my workload went up from about on our 70 to 8 hours a week to probably 120.,2505.0,2514.0,21,Elon_test
471, So yeah I got to sleep a wake up I work.,2514.0,2519.0,14,Elon_test
472, We're asleep wake up work do that seven days a week. I'll have to do that for a while no choice.,2519.0,2527.0,27,Elon_test
473, But I think once Twitter is set on the right path I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.,2527.0,2535.0,28,Elon_test
474, So and I really understand the internet and how to make so I wrote software for 20 years.,2535.0,2549.0,21,Elon_test
475, You know it's one of the key people behind.,2549.0,2555.0,13,Elon_test
476, So I also like I'm aware of like I know how to make a way better paypal.,2555.0,2567.0,22,Elon_test
477, Yeah yeah very much.,2567.0,2572.0,7,Elon_test
478, I mean with a lot of other people but there's there's a product plan I wrote which I wish I'd kept to copy over in July of 2000 where I thought it would be possible to make the most valuable financialists.,2572.0,2584.0,48,Elon_test
479, And we're going to execute that plan from 22 years ago which amazingly no one has done.,2584.0,2594.0,21,Elon_test
480, And so I think that's why part of why I think Twitter will be ultimately extremely valuable because I'm going to execute the X.com game plan from 22 years ago.,2594.0,2610.0,37,Elon_test
481, And I think we're also going to obviously make Twitter st way better system.,2610.0,2620.0,18,Elon_test
482, I mean it's a sense reason that you know if if the social media company is not taking steps to make it positive to be on that social path foam then people won't come or they'll leave.,2620.0,2639.0,43,Elon_test
483, You know so you speak of sort of anti-submortism or racism or anything like that.,2639.0,2644.0,23,Elon_test
484, Well I mean if who's going to stay on a platform if that's prevalent like that's obviously.,2644.0,2650.0,23,Elon_test
485, Yeah come on and it's inherent wrongness if who's going to stay on the platform.,2650.0,2656.0,21,Elon_test
486, So you want to be it needs to be something where like I go with Twitter is like how do we get 80% of America?,2656.0,2665.0,29,Elon_test
487, Maybe not like the sort of far left and the far right but and maybe we don't want to necessarily but how do we get 80% of the public to join a digital town square and voice their opinion and exchange ideas and maybe once in a while change their minds.,2665.0,2684.0,56,Elon_test
488, And occasion.,2684.0,2685.0,5,Elon_test
489, Yeah I mean once in a while.,2685.0,2689.0,10,Elon_test
490, So red also that you said and then we'll move off the Twitter but you said that your goal is you want to make the 20% of people who are on far right.,2689.0,2698.0,38,Elon_test
491, I hate you just like you want to make the 20% of people on the far left hate you so well I don't want them to hate me.,2698.0,2708.0,33,Elon_test
492, But I but I think the extremist like you know it's just very difficult to satisfy extremists.,2708.0,2714.0,23,Elon_test
493, So unless you fully buy into whatever their dog may is so.,2714.0,2721.0,15,Elon_test
494, But I think I'm confident we can satisfy like I don't know 80% of America 80% of the world and but maybe not the most the 10% most extreme of either side and I would count that as a great outcome.,2721.0,2734.0,49,Elon_test
495, And I think it I think it is important to have sort of a digital town square where people feel comfortable talking.,2734.0,2742.0,25,Elon_test
496, And I also think it's like one of the things is important is to be able to sort of decide what kind of experience you want to have on Twitter.,2742.0,2751.0,34,Elon_test
497, Because you know some people was might say okay like I want the like this was a radio station.,2751.0,2756.0,22,Elon_test
498, I want the easy listening smooth jazz station.,2756.0,2759.0,11,Elon_test
499, Okay cool but that's that's so you feel to have that setting for have that setting for Twitter and and and then some people might say like no I want heavy metal trash.,2759.0,2769.0,38,Elon_test
500, And and like okay so now this is going to be sort of then you then you don't mind someone saying mean things to you you know within the context of the law.,2769.0,2777.0,37,Elon_test
501, And you don't mind engaging in in vigorous arguments on Twitter that kind of thing.,2777.0,2782.0,20,Elon_test
502, But you're built to that kind of like pick pick your preference and and decide if if you want sort of full contact battle or or or do you want like no I just want to look at puppies and flowers and nice landscapes and stuff.,2782.0,2796.0,50,Elon_test
503, So so so let's go off Twitter.,2796.0,2799.0,11,Elon_test
504, Two other topics where he has some questions.,2799.0,2803.0,11,Elon_test
505," The number one is logistics when we're starting to to make so many cars by the end of this year 40,000 is 40,000 cars a week.",2803.0,2816.0,34,Elon_test
506," I mean after being careful of MNPI but I believe I have said in the past publicly that our aspiration is to reach 40,000 a week by the end of this year.",2816.0,2825.0,39,Elon_test
507, And doing that then that means that I'm producing car to 15 seconds.,2825.0,2831.0,17,Elon_test
508, Yeah.,2831.0,2832.0,4,Elon_test
509, And so but that's still only two million cars a year and there's a hundred million cars that are made a year.,2832.0,2841.0,27,Elon_test
510, And so the question so presumably capacity to be able to logistics to ship all these cars all over the place to have people pick them up where they want them.,2841.0,2852.0,34,Elon_test
511, But not if they all do them in the same week.,2852.0,2855.0,14,Elon_test
512, Yes totally. So I mean we're a bit of criticism from our Q3 results because we had a lot of cars and transit.,2855.0,2865.0,29,Elon_test
513, And the reason was that we got too big for our cars to actually be transported in the final few weeks.,2865.0,2872.0,24,Elon_test
514, There's word enough car carriers and word enough ships.,2872.0,2875.0,13,Elon_test
515, So but it's actually good it's actually good in the long run to to smooth out deliveries and actually have cars and transit into the quarter.,2875.0,2886.0,31,Elon_test
516, Because then you're not rushing to get everything delivered by the end of the quarter and paying all these expedite fees.,2886.0,2893.0,26,Elon_test
517, So my question though is if we have autonomous driving and we have autonomous trucks is that one of the ideas that we're going to be able to move things around with our own with the not enough drivers that we're going to have autonomous transport.,2893.0,2906.0,51,Elon_test
518, Yes.,2906.0,2907.0,4,Elon_test
519, That's question one.,2907.0,2908.0,7,Elon_test
520, We can also yeah I mean have if you're in the if you're in the area of how the car just drive to you.,2908.0,2915.0,29,Elon_test
521, That's one and the other one is about materials and when all of a sudden so we have somehow navigated supply chain problems from other people.,2915.0,2926.0,31,Elon_test
522, And you might have thought that it was the absolute brilliance that we had to be able to do that.,2926.0,2931.0,24,Elon_test
523, But probably the reason is that when you start off and you don't make any cars a year and you go to so many say we're going to make 20 million cars a year from zero.,2931.0,2940.0,41,Elon_test
524, Who's going to believe you and make all the equipment that we need so as a result of that you were forced initially to be able to say okay we're going to get you know we're vertically integrate we can't rely on you both vertically integration.,2940.0,2954.0,53,Elon_test
525, And yeah.,2954.0,2956.0,5,Elon_test
526, Cut it.,2956.0,2958.0,5,Elon_test
527, I can talk longer if you'd like.,2958.0,2960.0,11,Elon_test
528, Don't shoot the messenger.,2960.0,2962.0,8,Elon_test
529, Talk a little bit longer.,2962.0,2965.0,8,Elon_test
530, Materials how so we have to all we we anyone want to show us a mine.,2965.0,2970.0,20,Elon_test
531, We got people in mines to fake you know who are knowledgeable and they come to say we can produce this much lithium this much copper this much.,2970.0,2978.0,31,Elon_test
532, We are able to assess that and give contracts to be able to say contractual agreements.,2978.0,2985.0,20,Elon_test
533, Okay and they'll and they'll rely on our agreement other people they won't.,2985.0,2990.0,19,Elon_test
534, Is that fair and glencore the.,2990.0,2993.0,11,Elon_test
535, Well the scaling constraints change as time goes by and in the beginning we we were just very vertically integrated because suppliers didn't take us seriously like we could get hardly any of the a of the best suppliers wouldn't talk to us because the car startup has not been successful in the United States since Chrysler in the 20s I believe they started.,2993.0,3017.0,72,Elon_test
536, We've been a centuries since the car company was successful in the US that was not a not a foreign company coming in with that was already successful in their home market.,3017.0,3025.0,36,Elon_test
537, So but for an American car startup it was the first to tell us about success in a hundred years.,3025.0,3030.0,23,Elon_test
538, So you can imagine if you're an auto supplier that doesn't sound like a smart financial decision.,3030.0,3035.0,22,Elon_test
539, Exactly.,3035.0,3036.0,4,Elon_test
540, So then we we had to do just a lot of stuff ourselves be vertical integrated or we couldn't create the car.,3036.0,3045.0,26,Elon_test
541, So that ended up being an asset because now we understood so much about the entire supply chain or what it took to build a car.,3045.0,3053.0,29,Elon_test
542, So we were able to design a more integrated vehicle that that actually needed far fewer parts and cost less and ways less than has higher performance.,3053.0,3068.0,30,Elon_test
543, But it is looking increasingly like for some of the critical elements of batteries that Tesla will will need to get into the mining business mining and refining.,3068.0,3078.0,32,Elon_test
544, That's why Glencore was announced that's where we're talking to Glencore.,3078.0,3082.0,19,Elon_test
545, We were.,3082.0,3083.0,5,Elon_test
546," No, and we're we've never contemplated investing in Glencore.",3083.0,3088.0,17,Elon_test
547, I'm talking about Tesla doing it ourselves.,3088.0,3092.0,11,Elon_test
548, Yes.,3092.0,3093.0,4,Elon_test
549, Transmissions questions from the audience.,3094.0,3096.0,10,Elon_test
550, Just give me a couple.,3096.0,3098.0,8,Elon_test
551, Turn in the lights.,3098.0,3100.0,7,Elon_test
552, Two questions.,3100.0,3104.0,5,Elon_test
553, Two questions.,3104.0,3105.0,5,Elon_test
554, Two and a.,3105.0,3106.0,6,Elon_test
555, Who's there?,3106.0,3107.0,6,Elon_test
556, The power of that being.,3107.0,3108.0,8,Elon_test
557, I'll do it anyway.,3108.0,3109.0,8,Elon_test
558," I mean, is it from me or you?",3109.0,3110.0,12,Elon_test
559, I don't know.,3110.0,3112.0,7,Elon_test
560, Questions.,3112.0,3113.0,4,Elon_test
561," So by the way, if you leave before we give away the door prizes which were two Teslas,",3113.0,3121.0,23,Elon_test
562, you're not eligible to get the Teslas.,3121.0,3123.0,12,Elon_test
563, But go ahead.,3123.0,3124.0,6,Elon_test
564, I gave an extra one once.,3124.0,3128.0,9,Elon_test
565, I guess it's the last time.,3128.0,3130.0,10,Elon_test
566, But we're not going to do that again.,3130.0,3132.0,12,Elon_test
567, You got to be in your seat in order to get the Teslas.,3132.0,3135.0,17,Elon_test
568, I'm paying for it.,3135.0,3136.0,8,Elon_test
569, Not you.,3136.0,3137.0,5,Elon_test
570, Not you.,3137.0,3138.0,5,Elon_test
571, Questions.,3138.0,3139.0,4,Elon_test
572, Ealing.,3139.0,3147.0,5,Elon_test
573," Sanika once said, every genius has a touch of madness.",3147.0,3153.0,15,Elon_test
574, I thought you'd like that quote.,3153.0,3155.0,10,Elon_test
575, But I agree with the madness part.,3155.0,3159.0,10,Elon_test
576," So even with Tesla as a publicly traded company, I think it's down 40% or something from its high,",3159.0,3168.0,25,Elon_test
577, and I think that's what I think is selling at 70 times earnings.,3168.0,3174.0,17,Elon_test
578," Meanwhile, Mercedes-Benz, which now produces EVs, is selling for six times earnings and yielding 5%.",3174.0,3183.0,26,Elon_test
579, Why should I invest in Tesla rather than Mercedes-Benz?,3183.0,3189.0,15,Elon_test
580," Well, I actually rarely try to convince anyone to invest in Tesla.",3189.0,3197.0,16,Elon_test
581," Many times I've recommended people don't invest in Tesla, and I've said our stock is too high.",3197.0,3203.0,24,Elon_test
582, But then people just ignore me and keep buying the stock.,3203.0,3206.0,14,Elon_test
583, It's a reason.,3206.0,3208.0,7,Elon_test
584," So, I think at a very high level, I'd say that autonomy is an insanely fundamental breakthrough.",3208.0,3220.0,23,Elon_test
585," And no one is even close to Tesla for solving generalized autonomy, generalized self-driving vehicles.",3220.0,3228.0,21,Elon_test
586, No one's even close.,3228.0,3230.0,8,Elon_test
587," And with self-driving, as I was talking about earlier, the car becomes, quote, roughly five times more useful,",3230.0,3239.0,27,Elon_test
588, but it costs the same to build.,3239.0,3241.0,10,Elon_test
589," Now, can you imagine what would happen if the company was doing, we're doing like a 25% or 30% gross margins.",3241.0,3248.0,29,Elon_test
590," But suddenly, that same thing was five times more valuable.",3248.0,3256.0,14,Elon_test
591, What would that do to the value of Tesla?,3256.0,3260.0,12,Elon_test
592, And the value of that car?,3260.0,3262.0,9,Elon_test
593," The bug was the mind, actually.",3262.0,3266.0,10,Elon_test
594," So, you know, if you think of net present value of future cash flows,",3266.0,3272.0,19,Elon_test
595," if you actually do the math on that, it's insane.",3272.0,3276.0,15,Elon_test
596," Then there's also the Optimus program, which is our humanoid robot,",3276.0,3282.0,18,Elon_test
597, which we will leverage our manufacturing expertise and the intelligence we've developed for self-driving to have a useful humanoid robot.,3282.0,3294.0,27,Elon_test
598," Now, the economy is fundamentally GDP per capita times capita.",3294.0,3299.0,14,Elon_test
599," If you no longer have a constraint on capita because it would be useful humanoid robot,",3299.0,3303.0,20,Elon_test
600, it is not clear that there's any limit to the size of the economy.,3303.0,3310.0,18,Elon_test
601, And these things will actually happen.,3310.0,3318.0,9,Elon_test
602, So...,3318.0,3321.0,4,Elon_test
603," Okay, that's probably a good reason.",3321.0,3324.0,11,Elon_test
604, That one more question.,3324.0,3331.0,7,Elon_test
605," Okay, bring that to your side.",3331.0,3334.0,10,Elon_test
606," Okay, this is the last question.",3334.0,3338.0,10,Elon_test
607, Maybe.,3338.0,3341.0,4,Elon_test
608, Go ahead.,3341.0,3346.0,5,Elon_test
609," Given all the cars that you're going to make,",3346.0,3352.0,13,Elon_test
610," and I hope Ron's right, whether it's 10 million or 20 million,",3352.0,3356.0,18,Elon_test
611, you're going to need a lot of charging stations around the world.,3356.0,3362.0,16,Elon_test
612, Yes.,3362.0,3364.0,4,Elon_test
613, Have you thought about doing it more efficiently and more economically and better for our ecosystem from an ESG perspective?,3364.0,3377.0,24,Elon_test
614, Because you may or may not know there are 400 million existing streetlights in the world.,3377.0,3385.0,20,Elon_test
615," And every streetlight has pervasive, persistent electricity.",3385.0,3391.0,13,Elon_test
616," You could take some amount of those streetlights, which are half-owned by utilities,",3391.0,3397.0,20,Elon_test
617," and half-owned by cities, and repurpose that.",3397.0,3402.0,14,Elon_test
618, And that would probably be the most cost-efficient way to roll out millions of charging stations all over the world.,3402.0,3411.0,26,Elon_test
619," Well, thanks.",3411.0,3413.0,6,Elon_test
620, I think they actually are using that idea in London and some other cities.,3413.0,3418.0,17,Elon_test
621," But I mean, I think the long-term goal for us supercharger stations is that they all have solar,",3418.0,3425.0,25,Elon_test
622," like Tesla solar and batteries at them, so that they are as many as possible,",3425.0,3430.0,19,Elon_test
623," are self-sustaining, that the supercharger stations generate the energy during the day,",3430.0,3435.0,21,Elon_test
624, and then also have a localized battery pack to so that people can charge at night.,3435.0,3441.0,19,Elon_test
625, So that the Tesla supercharging stations would continue to function even in a zombie apocalypse.,3441.0,3448.0,20,Elon_test
626," So, just never know. That's coming one day. We know it.",3448.0,3451.0,18,Elon_test
627, It's just a matter of time.,3451.0,3456.0,10,Elon_test
628, Thank you very much. Thank you to Silky with you.,3456.0,3459.0,15,Elon_test
629, Silky?,3459.0,3461.0,5,Elon_test

633," And please subscribe to Twitter Verified, 8 bucks,",3480.0,3486.0,13,Elon_test
634," and actually it's technically at 7.99, so slightly less.",3486.0,3491.0,16,Elon_test
635," But I'd really encourage everyone here to use Twitter and, you know,",3491.0,3499.0,17,Elon_test
636," yeah, please do that.",3499.0,3501.0,8,Elon_test
637, Here we go.,3501.0,3504.0,6,Elon_test
638, How do we do this?,3506.0,3507.0,8,Elon_test
639, We're going to switch around.,3507.0,3510.0,9,Elon_test
